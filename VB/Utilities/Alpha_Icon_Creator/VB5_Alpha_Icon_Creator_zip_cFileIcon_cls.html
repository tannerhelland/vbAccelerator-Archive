' Filename:    cFileIcon.cls
' Author:      Steve McMahon (steve@vbaccelerator.com)
' Date:        2 January 1999
'
' Requires:    None
'
' Description:
' A class which reads and writes icons from files using the Win32 ICO
' file format.  It can also read icons from Executables (EXE, DLL, OCX
' etc).
' This gives full control over the size and colour depth to be loaded,
' something which cannot be achieved by any other method.
'
' Todo:
' This class can be used as the basis for a full icon editor; you just
' need to be able to set the AND and XOR bits from a bitmap...
'
'
' Based on C code provided in the MSDN article "Icons in Win32" by
' John Hornick.
