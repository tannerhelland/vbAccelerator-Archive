' Creates and manages an ARGB (32bit) GDI DibSection.
' This is DIB in which the bitmap bits are stored in windows
' memory so can be modified.
' See the RandomiseBits and Resample methods for how to do it.
'
' For example, fading in an out a 256x256 true colour DIB by
' directly modifying the bytes runs at 38fps on my machine
' (PII 266Mhz, 32Mb RAM, 8Mb ATI Xpert@Work AGP card)
'
' Note: for best performance, when compiling an executable check
' all the boxes on the Properties-Compile tab Advanced Optimisations
' button.  This really makes a difference! (e.g. the fading example
' ran at 22fps before I did this so &gt; 50%!).
