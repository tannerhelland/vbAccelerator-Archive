Incorrect usage of GDI resources in an application can have a terrible effect on an application, 
particularly if you introduce a leak into a painting routine.  This article presents a tracing
tool you can use to test an application's GDI and User object allocation for Windows 2000 or XP
systems.
</p><h2>GDI Resources</h2><p>
For a while I've been looking for a way of detecting leaks in GDI resources.  There 
are commercial applications such as those from NuMega which can achieve that, but
I've not always been in position to buy these.  The traditional technique of running
the application and watching how much memory is used/whether it kills the system
isn't particularly great!
</p><p>
In Windows 2000, Microsoft introduced
a new API call, <i>GetGuiResources</i> which provides assistance.
The call can only be used at a Process level, but nevertheless this is a great 
step forward for testing.  You can actually get Task Manager to show this on
the Processes tab if you're interested in doing a quick test or trying to 
check something on a remote system:
</p><img src="taskMgrGDIResources.png" width="150" height="178" alt="Configuring Columns&#xD;&#xA;in Task Manager's resources tab" /><br /><p><strong><small>Configuring Columns in Task Manager's resources tab</small></strong></p><img src="taskMgr.png" width="200" height="160" alt="Task Manager Showing GDI Objects" /><br /><p><strong><small>Task Manager Showing GDI Objects - VS.NET is winning again!</small></strong></p><p>
Unfortunately, you can't chart the result of this value in Task Manager or the Performance 
Monitor, so it can be a bit awkward to see exactly what's happening, which was the inspiration
for this utility.
</p><h2>The Resource Trace Utility</h2><p>
The trace utility itself uses the <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=2767">Visual Studio
Style Tab Control</a>, <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=4089">ListView Control</a> and
<a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=931">System Image List</a> from this site to provide
a nice UI for selection and tracing of resources in use by any application.
Simply select a window from the Windows tab docked to the left, and a
new tab opens in the working area with a trace of resources.  You can have as
many independent traces as you want open at once, and also save the result of 
any trace to an XML file.
</p><h2>Trying It - The Leaky App</h2><p>
If you want to see how catastrophic a small GDI leak can be, try the LeakyApp sample included
with the download.  This has an intentional flaw in the painting routine which leaks
a single GDI pen object each time the display is redrawn:
</p><img src="leakySample.png" width="358" height="255" alt="Leaky Demonstration Application" /><p>
Start the Resource Tracer running, then start the leaky app sample as an executable (if
you run it in the IDE, you can still trace the resources but you will need to trace the
VB IDE instance that's running it, and any resources associated with the IDE will also
be included).  Then double click on LeakyApp in the Windows tab of the Resource tracer.
</p><p>
When LeakyApp starts running, you will see initially it consumes something around 40 GDI
resources and 20 User resources.  Now resize the form a bit and watch what happens -
within a matter of moments the application can have over 1,000 GDI resources associated
with it (more than even Visual Studio.NET, which consumes GDI at an alarming rate).
</p><p>
Now check the "Stop Leaking" box and continue resizing. This patches up the
code to delete the last pen that's been created; as a consequence GDI usage will stay
stable (give or take a few points).  Of course you can't ever free up any of the 
resources you leaked earlier until the application ends (you have to take this as
read because there's no way of checking overall GDI resource usage on NT systems without
writing a device driver).
</p><p>
The consequence of a leak like this could be fatal to an application, particularly if
the application was being used on a Windows 9x system.  On Windows 9x, all GDI
resources are allocated in a global 16-bit heap - not only does that mean you only
have some 65,000 items to play with, but application using everything up means
that there's nothing left for any other application on the system either (you've probably
seem the consequence of this - no applications can paint themselves at all and all the fonts
go funny...)  On NT systems, things aren't so bad but ultimately
you will either run out of memory or be unable to create any further GDI resources, 
which means your app will stop painting.
</p><h2>Getting TaskLists and Determining the EXE For a Window</h2><p>
One of the elements of this sample is some code for retrieving the list of Windows in
the tasks list, and then determining which process id the task is associated with and
therefore the executable that created the Window.  This can come in handy for other
applications so I'll describe how its done in more detail here.
</p><h3>Getting the TaskList</h3><p>
Getting a task list is done by first enumerating all of the top level windows
and the system, and then filtering them according to some specific rules.
These elements are described in the articles 
<a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=4577">Enumerating Windows</a> and 
<a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=4578">Forcing a Window To Show in the Taskbar</a>.
A quick review of how you determine whether a window should appear in the task list
or not is as follows:
</p><ol><li>Check if the Window is visible:
<pre>
   If Not (IsWindowVisible(hWnd) = 0) Then
      ...
</pre></li><li>Get the Extended window style using <i>GetWindowLong</i>:
<pre>
      Dim lStyle As Long
      lStyle = GetWindowLong(hWnd, GWL_EXSTYLE)
</pre></li><li>Check if the <i>WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW</i> style is set.  If it
is, the window does not appear in the list:
<pre>
      If (lStyle And WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW) = 0 Then
         ...
</pre></li><li>Check if the <i>WS_EX_APPWINDOW</i> style is set.  If it is,
then the window should be included:
<pre>
         If (lStyle And WS_EX_APPWINDOW) = WS_EX_APPWINDOW Then
            bAdd = True
         Else
            ...        
</pre></li><li>Otherwise, check if the window is not owned by any other
window.  If it isn't then it should be included:
<pre>
            If (GetWindow(hWnd, GW_OWNER) = 0) Then
               bAdd = True
            End If
</pre></li></ol><p>
Once you have a list of windows, you can find the Process Id for each using
the <i>GetWindowThreadProcessId</i> API call - the return value is the
Thread Id, which you can ignore, and the ByRef second parameter returns
the process id.
</p><h3>Determing the ExeName for a Process Id</h3><p>
Once you have a process id, you are then in a position to find out the executable
name of the Window and to start tracing the GUI resources.  Getting the executable
name for a particular process id is achieved either using the easy way on 2000 and
XP using the Process Status Helper DLL (PSAPI.DLL), or the slightly harder way, 
by enumerating processes using the Tool Help functions.  Since this application
can only run on Windows 2000 and above, the PSAPI.DLL function
<i>GetModuleFileNameEx</i> is used:
</p><pre>
Private Declare Function GetModuleFileNameExW Lib "psapi.dll" ( _
    ByVal hProcess As Long, _
    ByVal hModule As Long, _
    ByVal lpFilename As Long, _
    ByVal nSize As Long _
    ) As Long

Public Function ExeNameForPid(ByVal lPid As Long) As String
Dim hProcess As Long
   hProcess = OpenProcess( _
       PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION Or PROCESS_VM_READ, 0, lPid)
   If Not (hProcess = 0) Then
      m_sFileName = ExeNameForProcess(hProcess)
      ExeNameForPid = m_sFileName
      CloseHandle hProcess
   End If
End Function

Private Function ExeNameForProcess(ByVal hProcess As Long) As String

   ReDim b(0 To MAX_PATH) As Byte
   Dim lPtrFileName As Long
   lPtrFileName = VarPtr(b(0))
   Dim lR As Long
   lR = GetModuleFileNameExW(hProcess, 0, lPtrFileName, MAX_PATH)
   If (lR &gt; 1) Then
      ReDim bR(0 To lR * 2 - 1) As Byte
      CopyMemory bR(0), b(0), lR * 2
      ExeNameForProcess = bR
   End If
   
End Function
