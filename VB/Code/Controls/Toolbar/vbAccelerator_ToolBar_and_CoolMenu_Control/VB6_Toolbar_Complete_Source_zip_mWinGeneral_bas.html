triggered without the Alt- key being pressed, othertimes they did not trigger
when they should.  The logic has been rewritten to correct this.</p><p class="update">Chevrons created by the toolbar did not trigger when clicked with 
the mouse.  Fixed.  The chevron now also uses a Menu window class as a base so it
draws in the same way as menus on the system.</p><p class="update">Some non-English keys did not work as accelerators. Fixed with code
provided by Sergey Pitutin.</p><p class="update">The Toolbar, Rebar and ToolbarHost controls could not be hosted
on a UserControl.  They now can. Thanks to Alexander Stetsenko for the information.</p><p class="update">The MDI buttons in the toolbar host control now render using XP
Visual Style if appropriate.  Thanks to Nguyen Tuan Anh for the suggestion.</p><p class="update"><i>SaveLayout</i> and <i>RestoreLayout</i> (beta) methods have been
added to the Rebar based on a method suggested by Ralph Brugger at LinkPool.  Feedback
