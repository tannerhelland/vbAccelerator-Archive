One of the main design aims behind the vbAccelerator TreeView control was to enable
more configurable and managable drag-drop operations to be performed.  This article
describes how to use the drag-drop features in two simple sample projects.
</p><h2>Drag Drop Styles in the TreeView Control</h2><p>
In the February 2004 release of the TreeView control, the style of drag-dropping
has been made configurable.  This allows you to choose between two different styles:
</p><ol><li><span class="code">etvwInsertMark</span><br />
The default drag drop mode shows an insert mark at the point you are going to place
the node you are dragging.  This lets you either re-order nodes within a tree or
change their parent, and hence is useful in applications where the order of items
is important.
</li><li><span class="code">etvwDropHighlight</span><br />
Drop-highlighting nodes is a more familiar drag-drop mode which is used in the
Folder pane in Explorer.  This mode allows you to change the parent of an item
but not to change the order of the items within a branch.  This makes more sense
for applications in which the information has no natural order, or a particular
order needs to be enforced.
</li></ol><p>
The download provides two samples which demonstrate how to use the drag-drop features.
The first populates the a single Tree with folders and allows
you to drag folders around (without actually affecting the disk).  The second is
a more sophisticated sample demonstrating how you might use insert dragging to build 
toolbars and menus which also shows dragging between controls.  The samples are
run from a disgraceful "spirit of '97 MS Access" switchboard form, for which I 
apologise.   In the rest of this article I'll first provide an overview of the things you
need to do to perform drag-drop and then a quick look at the samples.
</p><h2>Doing DragDrop</h2><h3>1. Getting Started</h3><p>
Before any drag-drop operations will occur with the vbAccelerator TreeView control, there 
are a handful of things you should configure (these can all be configured from the Properties
Window of the control):
</p><ol><li>Set the <span class="code">OLEDropMode</span> of the control to 1 
(<span class="code">vbOLEDropManual</span>).  Also, note that whilst Automatic
drag and drop modes appear to be supported, they aren't really.
Why this is the case is a long but
uncomplicated story involving vodka so please just accept that you need to 
do it.</li><li>Set <span class="code">DragAutoExpand</span> to <span class="code">True</span> if
you want collapsed nodes to automatically open as you drag over them.</li><li>Set the <span class="code">DragStyle</span> as described in the previous section.</li></ol><p>
Once that's done the control will start offering drag-drop features. Well, almost. Before you
can actually drag anything, you need to  give the control licence to start a dragging
operation by responding to the <span class="code">OLEStartDrag</span> event and setting the
<span class="code">AllowedEffects</span> parameter.  The following code example demonstrates
how you can configure whether dragging is allowed or not on a node-by-node basis:
</p><pre>
Private Sub tvwDrag_OLEStartDrag(Data As DataObject, AllowedEffects As Long)
   '
   ' Check if this is a root node:
   Dim nodDrag As cTreeViewNode
   Set nodDrag = tvwDrag.NodeFromDragData(Data)
   If (nodDrag.Parent Is Nothing) Then
      ' Cannot drag parent items
      AllowedEffects = vbDropEffectNone
   Else
      AllowedEffects = vbDropEffectMove
   End If
   '
End Sub
</pre><h3>2. Controlling Drag Drop</h3><p>
There are three functions and two events you need to use to control a drag-drop operation.
The first thing to understand is that during a drag-drop operation the control places
two things into the OLE <span class="code">Data</span> object associated with the drag-drop:
</p><ol><li>The Text of the node being dragged.</li><li>A private data format containing information allowing any TreeView control to 
determine which node is being dragged, and which control it was sourced from.</li></ol><p>
Whenever a node is being dragged, you can use the control's <span class="code">NodeFromDragData</span>
function to get a <span class="code">cTreeViewNode</span> object.  This affords control based
on the node being dragged.  To also determine where the target of the drag operation is, use the
<span class="code">DragInsertNode</span> function to get the node, and then if you are using 
the <span class="code">etvwInsertMark</span> drag style the <span class="code">DragInsertAbove</span>
function to determine whether to insert above or below the selected node.
</p><p>
Now that you can determine what's being dragged and where the user proposes to drag it to, you
can start building logic to control the drag operation.  
</p><ol><li>To conditionally enable/disable a drop,
use the <span class="code">OLEDragOver</span> event and set the <span class="code">AllowedEffects</span>
to tell the control what can be done.  (<span class="code">AllowedEffects</span> can be set to one of
the <span class="code">OLEDropEffectConstants</span> provided in VB). </li><li>When an item is actually dropped, the <span class="code">DragDropRequest</span> event is fired 
(this is actually just an enhanced version of the <span class="code">OLEDragDrop</span> event which
provides some more detail about the target node).  This event provides the <span class="code">Data</span>
object containing the OLEDrag data, the target node, whether to drop above or below and extended information
about the exact location of the target on the node.
</li></ol><h2>Dragging and Dropping Folders</h2><p>
The internal drag drop sample uses the code from the Shell samples also in this section
to populate a TreeView with file system folders.  Adding drag capability involves three
things:
</p><ol><li>Preventing dragging of items which can't be moved (the root items in the folder tree).</li><li>Validating the drag location of the folder to prevent it from being made a child of itself
or an illegal location.</li><li>Actually moving the item when it is dropped.</li></ol><p>
The first point is covered during the <span class="code">OLEStartDrag</span> event, which
simply checks whether the item is a root node using the <span class="code">Parent</span>
property of the dragging node:
</p><pre>
Private Sub tvwDrag_OLEStartDrag(Data As DataObject, AllowedEffects As Long)
   '
   ' Check if this is a root node:
   Dim nodDrag As cTreeViewNode
   Set nodDrag = tvwDrag.NodeFromDragData(Data)
   If (nodDrag.Parent Is Nothing) Then
      ' Cannot drag parent items
      AllowedEffects = vbDropEffectNone
   Else
      AllowedEffects = vbDropEffectMove
   End If
   '
End Sub
</pre><p>
The second is handled by creating a drag location verification function and calling
it during the <span class="code">OLEDragOver</span> event:
</p><pre>
Private Sub tvwDrag_OLEDragOver( _
      Data As DataObject, _
      Effect As Long, _
      Button As Integer, _
      Shift As Integer, _
      x As Single, y As Single, _
      State As Integer)
   
   ' Check if we're attempting to make something a child of
   ' itself:
   Dim nodDrag As cTreeViewNode
   Dim bOk As Boolean
   
   bOk = False
   
   ' Get drag node:
   Set nodDrag = tvwDrag.NodeFromDragData(Data)
   If Not (nodDrag Is Nothing) Then ' It isn't a treeview node
   
      ' Get drag insert point
      Dim nodInsert As cTreeViewNode
      Set nodInsert = tvwDrag.DragInsertNode()
      If Not (nodInsert Is Nothing) Then ' there is no current insert point
      
         bOk = validateDragLocation(nodDrag, nodInsert)
         
      End If
      
   End If
   
   Effect = IIf(bOk, vbDropEffectMove, vbDropEffectNone)
   
End Sub
</pre><p>Since the shell TreeView stores the path of the item within the
item's <span class="code">Key</span> this can be used to validate the
drag location.  As noted in the shell samples, the same path can appear
at more than one point in the tree, and hence to use it as a key it
needs to have some additional information added to it to make it unique.
In this case, I used a counter which is prepended to the path with a 
colon, the path can then be extracted from the data after that:
</p><pre>
Private Function validateDragLocation( _
       nodDrag As cTreeViewNode, _
       nodInsert As cTreeViewNode _ 
   ) As Boolean

   ' only ok if nodDrag's path is not a wholly
   ' contained child of nodInsert
   Dim sPathDrag As String
   Dim sPathInsert As String
   Dim iPos As Long
   Dim bOk As Boolean
   
   sPathDrag = nodDrag.Key
   iPos = InStr(sPathDrag, ":")
   sPathDrag = Mid(sPathDrag, iPos + 1)
   sPathInsert = nodInsert.Key
   iPos = InStr(sPathInsert, ":")
   sPathInsert = Mid(sPathInsert, iPos + 1)
   
   bOk = Not (InStr(sPathInsert, sPathDrag) = 1)
   validateDragLocation = bOk

End Function
</pre><p>
The final aspect is handled in the <span class="code">DragDropRequest</span>
event.  This performs an additional check for the validity of the drop location
which could have changed since the last <span class="code">OLEDragOver</span>
event.  If still ok, it asks for confirmation about the move, deletes the old
item and then adds a new one as a child of the node dragged over.  Since the
tree's children nodes are sorted, it automatically gets added in the right
location:
</p><pre>
Private Sub tvwDrag_DragDropRequest( _
      Data As DataObject, _
      nodeOver As vbalTreeViewLib.cTreeViewNode, _
      ByVal bAbove As Boolean, _
      ByVal hitTest As Long)
   '
   ' Check if we're attempting to make something a child of
   ' itself:
   Dim nodDrag As cTreeViewNode
   Dim nodParent As cTreeViewNode
   
   Set nodDrag = tvwDrag.NodeFromDragData(Data)
   If Not (nodDrag Is Nothing) Then ' not a treeview node
      If validateDragLocation(nodDrag, nodeOver) Then
         
         Dim sPathFrom As String
         Dim sPathTo As String
         Dim iPos As Long
         Dim sText As String
         Dim sNewKey As String
         Dim sOldKey As String
         Dim sOldPath As String
         
         sPathFrom = nodDrag.Key
         iPos = InStr(sPathFrom, ":")
         sPathFrom = Mid(sPathFrom, iPos + 1)
         sPathTo = nodeOver.Key
         iPos = InStr(sPathTo, ":")
         sPathTo = Mid(sPathTo, iPos + 1)
         If (Right(sPathTo, 1) &lt;&gt; "\") Then sPathTo = sPathTo &amp; "\"
         sPathTo = sPathTo &amp; nodDrag.Text
         Dim sQuestion As String
         sQuestion = "Are you sure you want to move the folder " &amp; vbCrLf _
            &amp; nodDrag.Text &amp; " (" &amp; sPathFrom &amp; ") " &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _
            " to " &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _
            nodeOver.Text &amp; " (" &amp; sPathTo &amp; ") ?" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _
            "Note: In this demo, NO changes to your folders on disk will be made"
         
         If (vbYes = MsgBox(sQuestion, vbQuestion Or vbYesNo)) Then
                        
            sText = nodDrag.Text
            sOldKey = nodDrag.Key
            sOldPath = sOldKey
            iPos = InStr(sOldPath, ":")
            sOldPath = Mid(sOldPath, iPos + 1)
            
            ' Delete the source drag node:
            nodDrag.Delete
            
            m_lID = m_lID + 1
            sNewKey = m_lID &amp; ":" &amp; sPathTo
                                    
            ' Move nodDrag to the right location:
            
            ' Put it in the new place:
            nodeOver.Children.Add , , sOldKey, sText, _
               m_cIml.ItemIndex(sOldPath, True), _
               m_cIml.ItemIndex(sOldPath, True)
               ' note we use the old key because we haven't
               ' actually physically moved the directory.
            
         End If
         
      End If
   End If
   
   '
End Sub
</pre><p>
If you wanted to physically change the folders, rather than just the display
in the demo, you could use the <span class="code">FileSystemObject</span> in the
Scriping Runtime or the Shell's <span class="code">SHFileOperation</span> API. 
Then rather than adding the node in the new place, just clear the children
of the target node and ask the code to refresh it once the move operation
has completed.
</p><h2>Dragging Between Controls</h2><p>
Moving and copying nodes between controls works pretty much the same way as it
does for internally dragging within a control, because you can determine
the node being dragged from the drag-drop data from any instance of the TreeView
control.  The only difference is that you can will also now want to start checking 
the source of the dragged node to see if it is appropriate to drop it at the target 
location.
</p><p>
The <span class="code">Owner</span> property of a node can be used for this purpose.
This returns the control that owns the node, although there is a slight hitch.
ActiveX controls authored in VB have an automatic wrapper generated around them,
called the <span class="code">Extender</span>.  It turns out that it is difficult
to return this object to the caller and so the <span class="code">Owner</span> property 
only returns the internal ActiveX control rather than the extender.  That means you
can't use VB's object identity test <span class="code">is</span> for comparison with
a control on a form, instead you need to use the owner's window handle instead.
Otherwise it is easy enough:
</p><pre>
Private Sub tvwSource_OLEDragOver( _
      Data As DataObject, _
      Effect As Long, _
      Button As Integer, _
      Shift As Integer, _
      x As Single, y As Single, _
      State As Integer)
Dim nodeDrag As cTreeViewNode
      
   Effect = vbDropEffectNone
   
   ' It does not matter which control instance
   ' you use to ask for the drag node:
   Set nodeDrag = tvwSource.NodeFromDragData(Data)

   ' Check that the drag-data is from a TreeView:
   If Not (nodeDrag Is Nothing) Then

      ' If so, then see if it is coming from the
      ' selected control.  If it is, then allow
      ' the move, otherwise don't allow it:
      If (nodeDrag.Owner.hwnd = tvwSelected.hwnd) Then
         Effect = vbDropEffectMove
      End If

   End If
   
End Sub
</pre><p>
The multi-control drag drop sample provides a reasonably full-featured
sample of using this functionality.  You can drag from the source TreeView
to make copies in the selected TreeView, and also internally re-order
items within the selected TreeView.  Dragging from selected back to 
source allows items to be deleted.  

Note one other useful feature demonstrated in the sample: when internally
dragging nodes you should never allow a node to be dropped in a position where
it would be made a child of itself.  You can easily check this in cases where
the same item cannot appear more than once in the tree by using the 
the <span class="code">IsParentOf</span> function of the drag
Node on the target node before allowing a drop.
</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
This article has described how to use the drag-drop features in the vbAccelerator
TreeView control and provides samples showing drag-drop in use.
