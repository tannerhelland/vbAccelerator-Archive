' Filename: cHeader control
' Author:   Steve McMahon (steve@vbaccelerator.com)
' Date:     02 June 1998
'
' Requires: SSUBTMR.DLL
'
' Description
' An implementation of the Common Control header control.
'
' Changes:
' 26/11/03 SPM
' * Added unicode setting to correct problem with Filter setting
'
' 15/03/03 SPM
' * Added grouping support.
'
' 14/03/03  SPM
' * Added Unicode support for NT
' * Added Filter style and supporting ColumnFilter properties
' * Added IdealHeight method
'
' 25/07/99, SPM
' * Added Owner-Draw support.
'
' 01/01/99, SPM
' * Attempt to set ColumnImage to -1 (no icon) or an index not in the ImageList
'   caused GPF.
' * AddColumn method set image to the first image in the ImageList when no Image
'   specified.
' * ColumnHeader property set to "" caused no change or a corrupt string to
'   appear in the header and ColumnHeader property.
' * RemoveColumn for column other than the last one caused the ColumnTags to be
'   incorrect.
' * Don't raise ColumnEndDrag event when cancel column dragging
' * Added method for getting or setting column order (ColumnIndex).
' * Added method for getting and setting column alignment (ColumnTextAlign).
' * Added method for getting and setting image alignment left/right
 (ColumnImageOnRight).
' * Previous version re-created the control from scratch when setting styles,
 this
'   was not necessary. Now just the style is changed for a smoother display.
'
' Issues:
' Full Drag mode does not work - drag-drop not supported.
' No tool-tips.
