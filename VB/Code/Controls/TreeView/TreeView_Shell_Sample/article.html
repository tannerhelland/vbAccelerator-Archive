This article demonstrates a very simple way to populate a TreeView with files and or folders
using the <span class="i">Shell Automation Object</span> provided in Shell32.DLL.  
Using this object in combination with a <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=931">System Image List</a>
allows you to easily provide a browsable view of the file system with correct icons for
each element.
</p><h2>About the Shell Automation Object</h2><p>
With version 4.71 of Shell32.DLL, released with IE 4.0 and included in Windows 98/2000 and above
Microsoft finally included some methods to make the wilfully obscure Shell API a bit easier
to use from higher-level languages.  The methods are exposed from a TypeLibrary embedded within
Shell32.DLL called  "Microsoft Shell Controls and Automation", and include methods for browsing
the Shell's namespace as well as performing some common Shell tasks such as launching Control Panel
Items, opening the Find dialogs and so on. 
</p><p>
To give an example of using the API, here is how you can get a list of all items in My Computer:
</p><pre>
   Dim shl As New Shell
   Dim drives As Folder
   Dim driveItem As FolderItem

   Set drives = shl.NameSpace(ssfDRIVES)
   For Each driveItem In drives.items
      Debug.Print driveItem.Name, driveItem.Path
      If (driveItem.IsFolder) Then
         ' You can get the sub items using driveItem.Folder
      End If
   Next 
</pre><p>
One thing that is unfortunately missing from this however is a 
method to get hold of the icon for a given item in the shell.
</p><p>
When using the low-level Shell32 API, the icon for an item in the Shell namespace can always be obtained
from it's <span class="code">PIDL</span>, a foolishly named structure that describes a "pointer to an ID 
List"; an ID list being a structure which effectively represents the path to a folder 
regardless of whether it is implemented as a physical directory on the file system or whether it is
a virtual construct such as "My Computer".  In the higher level API the <span class="code">PIDL</span>
is not accessible so another route is needed to find the icon.  Luckily, for file-system related 
items this is quite easy to achieve using a <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=931">System Image List</a>.
</p><p>
Getting the icon for an actual file system item with a normal path is described in the System
Image List article, so I won't cover it again here.  For items like the Desktop and My Computer,
however, you can still retrieve the icon using a path fromt the Shell Automation object
because even though these items are virtual, they have another form of path addressing which
uses GUIDs to identify an item.  This system does not appear to be much documented at MSDN, but
here a handful of commonly occuring objects:
</p><table class="article"><tr class="header"><td>Object</td><td>'Path'</td></tr><tr><td>My Computer</td><td>::{20D04FE0-3AEA-1069-A2D8-08002B30309D}</td></tr><tr><td>My Network Places</td><td>::{208D2C60-3AEA-1069-A2D7-08002B30309D}</td></tr><tr><td>Internet Explorer</td><td>::{871C5380-42A0-1069-A2EA-08002B30309D}</td></tr><tr><td>Recycle Bin</td><td>::{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}</td></tr></table><p>
These GUID based paths are accepted as if they were filenames by the System Image List, and
so you can obtain the correct icons.   This means you can create a fairly comprehensive
shell object browser using hardly any code.
</p><h2>Populating a Tree With Shell Objects</h2><p>
There are three things you need to be able to do to create a TreeView showing shell
objects:
</p><ol><li>Associate a System ImageList with the TreeView</li><li>Be able to sort items in a consistent way.  If you just show folders
then they should be sorted alphabetically, otherwise the items should be
sorted alphabetically with folders appearing before files.</li><li>Be able to uniquely identify the file system object that any item in the tree 
represents.  Note that the Shell namespace can include the same folder 
in more than one place (for example, the Documents folders typically appear
under both My Computer and in the Document and Settings folder of the installation
drive).</li></ol><p>
I'll cover these in turn.
</p><h3>Associating a System Image List With the Tree</h3><p>
The easiest way to achieve this is to use the code in the vbAccelerator
System Image List class.  Here's the code used to set up the ImageList:
</p><pre>
Private m_cIml As cVBALSysImageList

   ...
 
   Set m_cIml = New cVBALSysImageList
   m_cIml.IconSizeX = 16
   m_cIml.IconSizeY = 16
   m_cIml.Create
   tvwDirs.ImageList = m_cIml.hIml
</pre><p>
With this in place, the icon index for a Tree Node can be obtained from its
path using the following code.  Note the use of use of the <span class="code">bForceLoadFromDisk</span>
to ensure the correct icon is loaded; if you do not specify this then the code assumes
the object is of type file and will not work for folders, regardless of whether they
are file system or not.
</p><pre>
    lIconIndex = m_cIml.ItemIndex(item.Path, True)
</pre><h3>Sorting Items</h3><p>
There are two potential approaches that could be taken to sorting items: either
you could collate all of the items into a temporary array and sort that, or, 
and more simply use the features of the vbAccelerator TreeView control to do 
the sorting for you.  The latest release of the control offers a range of sorting
methods, including an event-driven callback method in which you can code any
sorting scheme.  In this case, however, items are sorted alphabetically and
may need to be sorted into folder/item groups.  The easiest way to support this is to
use the TreeView node <span class="code">ItemData</span> to encode whether the
item is a folder or an item and then use the <span class="code">etvwItemDataThenAlphabetic</span>
sorting mode built into the control.
</p><p>
The TreeView allows you to configure sorting so it is automatically applied, or it can be
manually applied.  Automatic sorting is convenient but for large numbers of items does
not perform very well because it resorts every time an item is added.  If you include files
then the Windows\System directory can frequently contain in excess of 3,000 objects, and hence 
the more performant manual sort is a better option.
</p><p>
Here is a code outline of adding folders and items to a TreeView node and then 
sorting them:
</p><pre>
   Set nodes = parentNode.Children

   For Each itm In items.items
      If (itm.IsFolder) Then
         Set nod = nodes.Add(, , , itm.Name, _
            m_cIml.ItemIndex(itm.Path, True))
         nod.ItemData = 0
         nod.Children.Add , , , "Unexpanded"
      Else
         Set nod = nodes.Add(, , sKey, itm.Name, _
            m_cIml.ItemIndex(itm.Path, True))
         nod.ItemData = 1
      End If
   Next

   parentNode.Sort etvwItemDataThenAlphabetic
</pre><h3>Uniquely Identifying the File System Object</h3><p>
The vbAccelerator TreeView uses a key to identify each node.  This is a
good place to store the path of the object that's being added to the tree;
however, the key must be unique and the same path may appear more than once in the tree
something needs to be done.
</p><p>
The solution adopted in the same is to prepend a unique ID number to the path
and then use that as the key.  By using a colon as a separator between the prepended ID and 
the path it is easy to extract again by finding the first occurrence of a colon in the 
key using <span class="code">Instr</span>.
</p><h2>Wrapping it up: The Demonstrations</h2><p>
The demonstrations bring these techniques together into two samples: one which shows
directories only and another which shows all Shell objects in the same view in a
similar manner to the Browse for Folder dialog with files showing. The basic technique
is to seed the tree with an inital namespace (in the case of the samples, 
<span class="code">ssfDRIVES</span> is used, but this could be changed to any other
folder or the Desktop using <span class="code">ssfDESKTOP</span> if desired.
</p><p>Whenever
a folder is created, a dummy item is added as a child.  Then code in the
<span class="code">BeforeExpand</span> event is added to check for the dummy item:
if it finds it then the dummy is removed and the contents of the sub folder populated
in exactly the same way as for the initial load.  Note that the 
<span class="code">BeforeCollapse</span> or <span class="code">Collapse</span>
event could also be coded to remove any non-dummy items if you wanted to reduce
the memory needed to show the Tree.
</p><p>
Although not coded here, you can also use the <span class="code">Verbs</span> 
collection of the <span class="code">FolderItem</span> object to get a list of
all the actions that can be performed in a right-click menu for any of the 
items in the view.
</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
This article demonstrates how to populate a TreeView with Shell namespace objects complete
with icons with very little code.  Performance is pretty much equal to Explorer, 
although for very large directories
will feel a little slower because the application is single threaded (Explorer populates some
directories on a background thread which can appear more responsive).
The demonstrations should prove useful for any application which wants a customised folder 
picker or a Folder view.
