from the implementation within COMCTL32.DLL. However, this implementation only allows you to 
play AVIs with no audio stream. Also, its idea of transparency isn't quite what 
you might expect: setting an AVI to transparent only sets one of the colours in the 
AVI to another colour, rather than allowing you to draw part of the background.</p><p>If you want to play any type of AVI, or you want to modify the contents of the 
transparent area, you must load and draw the AVI yourself using the API. Luckily, this API is 
easily accessible to VB coders.</p><h2>The Transparent AVI Control</h2><p>The transparent AVI control supplied with the download is a simple implementation 
based around reuse of a class, <i>cAVICtrl.cls</i>. This class allows you to play an AVI onto any window. 
The implementation includes code to tile a bitmap into the background of the control. Use of the 
control is pretty self explanatory. To set up the control to show an AVI transparently over 
a background bitmap the code looks like this:</p><pre>
With vbalAVIPlayer1
   .Filename = App.Path &amp; "\clock.avi"
   .Load
   .Picture = picBackground.Picture
   .Transparent = True
   .TransparentColor = &amp;H0&amp;
End With
</pre><p>To start and stop the AVI playing, use the <i>Running</i> property.</p><h2>The API for Playing AVI</h2><p>Basically the API for playing AVIs is found in two DLLs: the AVI support DLL 
Avifil32.Dll and the Video for Windows DLL msvfw32.dll (incidentally, to find out more about working 
out which DLL contains which function, have a look at the article <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=3377">Finding 
Which DLL Contains an API Call</a>.). AVI loading, reading and interrogation is provided by 
the AVI support DLL, whilst Video for Windows provides some functions for rendering a DIB 
directly from memory onto a device context, without having to create an intermediate GDI DIB 
Section or memory device context to Blit it from.</p><h2>The DrawDib API</h2><p>The DrawDib API is aimed at fast rendering of DIBs (Device Independent Bitmaps) to screen without 
the intermediate use of any GDI objects. This was important in 16 bit versions of windows, however, 
most graphic card device drivers now deal with DIBs very quickly so the performance aspect of 
this API is no longer relevant. It does help simplify drawing AVI frames, however, 
so it is used in this project. There are three DrawDib API calls used:</p><ol><li><strong>DrawDibOpen</strong><br />
Opens a DrawDib device and returns a handle to it.</li><li><strong>DrawDibDraw</strong><br />
Draws a DIB from memory onto a device context. This call is very similar to the GDI 
<i>StretchBlt</i> call except rather than taking a source DC it takes a pointer to the DIB 
bits and a pointer to the DIB colour table. These pointers are provided directly by the 
AVI API, as we will see next.</li><li><strong>DrawDibClose</strong><br />
Closes a previously opened DrawDib device.</li></ol><h2>The AVI Support API</h2><p>Actually reading and use AVIs is performed using this DLL. To start using the DLL, call 
<i>AVIFileInit</i> and when finished, call <i>AVIFileExit</i>.</p><p>To open an AVI file for playing, the <i>AVIStreamOpenFromFile</i> function is used:</p><pre>
Private Declare Function AVIStreamOpenFromFile Lib "avifil32.dll" _
    Alias "AVIStreamOpenFromFileA" ( _
      ppavi As Any, ByVal szFile As String, _
      ByVal fccType As Long, ByVal lParam As Long, _
      ByVal mode As Long, pclsidHandler As Any _
      ) As Long
</pre><ul><li><strong>ppAVI</strong> is a pointer to the AVI stream, and is returned when the call returns. 
Passing a long value in as this parameter allows us to return this pointer.</li><li><strong>szFile</strong> is the file to open.</li><li><strong>fccType</strong> defines which type of stream we want to read from, in 
this case the video stream (MMIO type "vids", which is &amp;H73646976 as a long value)</li><li><strong>lParam</strong> is an application defined value, and can be set to anything you want.</li><li><strong>mode</strong> is the file mode, the same as the file mode values used 
in the file APIs in Win32.</li><li><strong>pclsidHandler</strong> is a pointer to a CLSID if you take advantage of 
the OLE interface to the AVI functions (not used in this sample).</li></ul><p>The return value from the function is a COM <i>HRESULT</i>.  Whilst a HRESULT sounds like it should
be a handle to a result, it is actually just a long value where the bits are arranged in a particular
way:</p><img src="hresult.gif" width="294" height="79" alt="Format of a HRESULT" /><p><strong><small>Format of a HRESULT value</small></strong></p><p>The most significant bit of the HRESULT (bit 31, which can be extracted by ANDing with &amp;H80000000) 
determines whether the function call succeeded or failed. It is set for failure.</p><p>The bits betwen bit 30 and bit 16 contain what is termed the "facility" code. Microsoft 
use this to separate different errors out, for example, control errors are supposed to set 
<i>FACILITY_CONTROL</i> (=10) in this section whilst Win32 errors set <i>FACILITY_WINDOWS</i> (=7).</p><p>The low order word is the return code which specifies the code for the success or failure condition.</p><p>Since HRESULTs can be either success or failure codes, it is not enough just to check 
whether the return value is zero or positive. C and C++ coders take advantage of the Macros FAILED and SUCCEEDED 
which are defined in one of the COM header files; but these are simple to rewrite in VB:</p><pre>
   Private Function FAILED(ByVal hr As Long) As Boolean
      FAILED = Not (SUCCEEDED(hr))
   End Function
   Private Function SUCCEEDED(ByVal hr As Long) As Boolean
      SUCCEEDED = ((hr And &amp;H80000000) = 0)
   End Function
</pre><p>If <i>AVIStreamOpenFromFile</i> succeeds, then the long variable passed into the <i>ppAVI</i> parameter is a 
pointer to the AVI stream. We can then open the AVI for playing and find out more about the AVI.</p><p>To open the stream for playing, we call:</p><pre>
   Private Declare Function AVIStreamGetFrameOpen Lib "avifil32.dll" ( _
      pavi As Any, lpbiWanted As Any _
      ) As Long
</pre><ul><li><strong>pavi</strong> Takes a pointer to the AVI stream returned in the <i>ppavi</i>
parameter earlier. Because the original return value was a pointer to a pointer (**) we need to pass 
the value using the ByVal keyword into the <i>pavi</i> method of this call. The 
same applies for all subsequent calls which take <i>pavi</i> as a parameter.</li><li><strong>lpbiWanted</strong> This parameter allows you to pass in a <i>BITMAPINFOHEADER</i> structure 
indicating the format of DIB you would like the AVI functions to return. It can be 
set to Null (ByVal 0&amp;) to return the default format.</li></ul><p>If this function succeeds it returns a long pointer to the GetFrame interface (<i>pGF</i>), otherwise 
it returns 0.</p><p>Once both the <i>pavi</i> and <i>pGF</i> pointers have been returned, the AVI can then be queried 
for information about its size, shape and so forth. All AVIs are encoded as a series of 
"samples" (i.e. frames) which have a particular duration. This function returns the time 
in milliseconds for a given sample in the AVI:</p><pre>
   Private Declare Function AVIStreamSampleToTime Lib "avifil32.dll" _
      (pavi As Any, ByVal lSample As Long) As Long
</pre><p>The <i>AVIStreamLength</i> function returns the number of samples in the AVI, 
which in turn directly indicates the duration of the AVI if passed into the <i>AVIStreamSampleToTime</i> function:</p><pre>
   Private Declare Function AVIStreamLength Lib "avifil32.dll" _ 
       (pavi As Any) As Long
</pre><p>To find the position of the first sample in the AVI (which again can be converted into a 
time using <i>AVIStreamSampleToTime</i>) we use <i>AVIStreamStart</i>:</p><pre>
   Private Declare Function AVIStreamStart Lib "avifil32.dll" _
       (pavi As Any) As Long
</pre><p>To get more general information about the AVI, such as size, name, samples per second to play 
and so forth, the <i>AVIStreamInfo</i> function fills in a <i>TAVISTREAMINFO</i> structure for a 
given AVI stream pointer. The declare of the function looks like this:</p><pre>
   Private Declare Sub AVIStreamInfo Lib "avifil32.dll" Alias "AVIStreamInfoA" _
      (pavi As Any, psi As TAVISTREAMINFO, ByVal lSize As Long)

   Private Type TAVISTREAMINFO ' this is the ANSI version
      fccType As Long
      fccHandler As Long
      dwFlags As Long '/* Contains AVITF_* flags */
      dwCaps As Long
      wPriority As Integer
      wLanguage As Integer
      dwScale As Long
      dwRate As Long ' /* dwRate / dwScale == samples/second */
      dwStart As Long
      dwLength As Long '; /* In units above... */
      dwInitialFrames As Long
      dwSuggestedBufferSize As Long
      dwQuality As Long
      dwSampleSize As Long
      rcFrame As RECT
      dwEditCount As Long
      dwFormatChangeCount As Long
      szName(0 To 63) As Byte
   End Type
</pre><p>To find out more, have a look at the code in the <i>cAviCtrl.cls</i> in the full source code 
download.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p></td><td class="rightbar" valign="top" bgcolor="#C2BEB1">
