' Creates and manages a 256 colour GDI DibSection.  This is DIB
' in which the bitmap bits are stored in windows memory so can
' be modified.  Also, there are only 256 colours (1 byte/pixel)
' and the colour palette can be modified using GetDIBColorTable
' and SetDIBColorTable.  This means fades etc can be achieved
' by simply manipulating the DIB Color Table, rather than
' modifying the bitmap bits.  By doing this, a fade on a
' 512x512 fade can run much quicker than the equivalent for a
' True Colour DIB.
' The speed you run at depends on how your gfx driver implements
' DIB colour tables.  On a 8Mb ATI Xpert@Work, Win95, this code
' runs at &gt; 300 fps for a 256x256 DIB!  However, on a 4Mb Matrox
' Millenium, NT it runs at less speed.
'
' Note: for best performance, when compiling an executable check
' all the boxes on the Properties-Compile tab Advanced Optimisations
' button, particularly Remove Array Bounds checks.
