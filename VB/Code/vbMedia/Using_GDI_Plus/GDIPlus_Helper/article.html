The GDI+ Wrapper project is a DLL that works on top of Dana Seaman's 
excellent GDI+ Type Library and aims to provide COM applications with a 
wrapper providing equivalent functionality to the C++ and .NET GDI+ classes.
</p><p>
The current version provides support for Images and Bitmaps.  Further 
contributions to the library are encouraged!
</p><h2>About GDI+</h2><p>
GDI+ is Microsoft's new graphics programming API for Windows that
offers enhanced functionality over the existing GDI functions.
In particular, you get built in support for many more graphics
file formats, colour-management functions, alpha and gamma functions for
drawing, extremely powerful transformation functions and much more.
</p><p>
GDI+ can be used in all Windows-based applications. GDI+ is included 
with Microsoft Windows XP and Windows .NET Server operating systems. 
However, it can also be installed from the freely available
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?releaseid=32738">Microsoft redistributable</a>
for applications that run on Windows NT 4.0 SP6, Windows 2000, 
Windows 98, and Windows Millennium Edition operating systems:
</p><h2>Using GDI+ From VB</h2><p>
Whilst the GDI+ library distributed with the Platform SDK is packaged in
a form usable by C/C++ developers, this doesn't preclude using it in
other languages.  For example, the <i>System.Drawing</i> namespace in .NET provides
a thin Managed-code wrapper around the GDI+ functions.
</p><p>
Using it from VB though is more difficult.  The next section describes these
in more detail and how they are overcome in the library.  However, the 
excellent starting point for this code is 
Dana Seaman's <a href="mailto:dseaman@cyberactivex.com">dseaman@cyberactivex.com</a>
GDI+ Type Library, which includes all but a tiny portion of the structures,
enumerations and declares you need to call GDI+ functions.  You can download
his Type Library, and his example project which demonstrates a highly 
sophisticated Unicode-based drawing using alpha, texture brushes and much more
from <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=3355">Planet Source Code</a> here:
</p><p class="indent"><a href="http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=42861&amp;lngWId=1">http://www.Planet-Source-Code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=42861&amp;lngWId=1</a></p><p>
Please go there and give him your vote, and voice some nice opinions since 
this is a fantastic effort.
</p><p>
However, whilst the Type Library gives you direct access to the native functions,
it doesn't allow you to use GDI+ in the same way that most of the articles 
demonstrate since the actual GDI+ class library is not included.  In addition,
some of the GDI+ functions (like Property Id tags and Image Encoder Parameters) 
are declared in an unfriendly way, which means you need additional code beyond
the Type Library declares to call them safely.
</p><p>
This article presents a Visual Basic COM wrapper that emulates (and in some
cases needs to provide enhancements to make the functions easier to use) the GDI+ 
class library.  As noted, this version only implements Image and Bitmap related
functionality.  Please read the contribution details below to find out how
you can help to add more functions to the library (text, brushes and
pens are the next on the list).
</p><h2>Building A GDI+ Wrapper</h2><p>
This section of the article details some of the issues 
that occurred as I built this library and how I worked around them.
</p><p>
There are some difficulties with direct translation of the GDI+ class
library, some related to COM and some related to Visual Basic.  I'll
cover these in turn.
</p><h3>1. COM Translation Problems</h3><ol><li><strong>Implementation Inheritance</strong><br />
In GDI+, for example, the <i>Bitmap</i> class extends <i>Image</i>.  By
appropriate casting, you can therefore access all of the <i>Image</i>'s 
functions from a <i>Bitmap</i>.  COM only supports Interface Inheritance, 
so whilst you could emulate the GDI+ version using interfaces, this means
the same code would have to be written multiple times in concrete instances of 
the interface.
</li><li><strong>Method Overloading</strong><br />
The class library makes extensive use of method overloading to provide
multiple versions of the same method with different parameters.  For
example, there are some 20 or so different versions of the <i>DrawImage</i>
function within the <i>Graphics</i> class.  In COM each method requires
its own name.
</li><li><strong>Parameterised Constructors</strong><br />
COM does not support initialising a class with parameters.  So whilst 
the library offers ways to construct, for example, an instance of
the <i>Bitmap</i> class with the specified pixel format and size,
a COM call can only construct a default instance.
</li></ol><p>
All of these problems can be resolved by the use of programming
conventions in the converted wrapper object.
</p><ol><li><strong>Implementation Inheritance.</strong><p>
I have chosen to make the base class(es) available through a property
get call on the subclass.  So for example, my <i>Bitmap</i> class
offers and <i>Image</i> Property Get, which returns an Image class
for the bitmap.  This is slightly more awkward to use but ensures
complete consistency of functionality without code duplication.
</p><p>
For example, in GDI+ you can access the <i>Width</i> property
of a <i>Bitmap</i> directly:
</p><pre>
   Bitmap* bm = new Bitmap(L"Spiral.png");
   printf("\nBitmap width:%d\n", bm.GetWidth());
</pre><p>
In my class library you need to get the <i>Image</i> object of the
<i>Bitmap</i> first:
</p><pre><font color="#58596C"></font><font color="#3D4187">Dim </font><font color="#58596C">bm </font><font color="#3D4187">as New </font><font color="#58596C">GDIPBitmap
   bm.FromFile(</font><font color="#800000">"Spiral.png"</font><font color="#58596C">)
   Debug.</font><font color="#3D4187">Print </font><font color="#800000">"Bitmap Width:"</font><font color="#58596C">; bm.Image.</font><font color="#3D4187">Width
</font></pre></li><li><strong>Method Overloading</strong><br /><p>
Here I chose to add to the method name to indicate
which function is supported.  So for example, the <i>Graphics</i> class
supports four different ways of drawing a bitmap into a rectangular 
area: two take integer parameters and two use real parameters, and 
there is a version which takes a rectangle structure and a version
which takes individual parameters in each case.  In the resulting
library, I add the word Rect and then a couple of prefixes to 
indicate which is which:
</p><ul><li><b>DrawImageRectL</b> - The <i>L</i> indicates long parameters.</li><li><b>DrawImageRectLv</b> - The <i>v</i> indicates the method takes the values
directly, rather than the structure containing the values.</li><li><b>DrawImageRectF</b> - The <i>F</i> indicates real parameters.</li><li><b>DrawImageRectFv</b> - The <i>v</i> indicates values rather than a structure again.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Parameterised Constructors</strong><br /><p>
Here I either use existing methods of the class which are
equivalent to the constructor (for example, <i>Bitmap</i>
has a <i>FromFile</i> method which is equivalent to
constructing a Bitmap with a file name parameter) or
add a new Create[xxx] method, where [xxx] describes the
type of creation required.
</p></li></ol><h3>2. VB Translation Problems</h3><ul><li><strong>Unicode Strings</strong><br /><p>
The entire GDI+ library is Unicode based (although obviously if you're 
working on Windows 98 or ME you're still restricted to displaying characters
available on the installed character set).  Therefore when declaring 
functions you cannot use VB's <i>As String</i> construct, because
VB automatically converts all such string parameters to ANSI before
making the declared call.  Using a Type Library to call the declarations
greatly assists with this since function declarations can include
Unicode string parameters.
</p><p class="tipHeader">Tip: Working With Pointers and Unicode Strings</p><div class="tip"><p>
If you can't use a direct Type Library declaration to resolve a Unicode
problem, as for example when a string is a member of a structure passed
in and out of a function, then you can usually work around the problem
quite easily using arrays of bytes, <i>CopyMemory</i> and <i>lstrlenw</i>.
</p><p>
For example, to create a pointer to a Unicode string to pass into a
function, just convert the string to an array of bytes and then use
the pointer to the first byte:
</p><pre>
   ' Convert string into a byte array:
   Dim b() As Byte
   b = "This is the String"

   ' Add null termination:
   Redim Preserve b(0 To Ubound(b) + 2) As Byte

   ' Get the pointer to the string:
   Dim lPtrString As Long
   lPtrString = VarPtr(b(0))
</pre><p>
If the function doesn't modify the pointer during execution, then
the byte array will contain the new string when the function completes.
If the function does modify the pointer, or returns you a new
one, then you can use <i>lstrlenw</i> and <i>CopyMemory</i>:
</p><pre>
   ' Find the length of the string:
   Dim lSize As Long
   lSize = lstrlenw(ByVal lPtrString)
   
   ' Create a buffer large enough to hold it:
   ReDim b(0 To lSize * 2 - 1) As Byte

   ' Copy the string into the buffer:
   CopyMemory ByVal VarPtr(b(0)), ByVal lPtrString, lSize * 2

   ' Convert back into a string:
   Dim theString As String
   theString = b
</pre><p>
Finally, remember that any buffers that you do set up must be
valid within the scope of the function call you're going to
make.  For example, although it may be convenient to provide
a function to return a pointer to the
appropriate bytes, this will only work if the bytes you
allocate are still in memory when the function returns:
</p><p><small>Bad</small></p><pre>
Public Function EvalVisibleSize(ByVal sText As String) As Long
Dim lBuf As Long
   lBuf = getStringPtr(sText)
   ' This will crash as lBuf doesn't point to anything!
   DrawTextW m_hDc, lBuf, -1, m_TextR, _
      DT_MODIFYSTRING Or DT_END_ELLIPSIS or DT_SINGLELINE
   EvalVisibleSize = lstrlenw(lBuf)
End Function

Private Function getStringPtr(ByVal sText As String) As Long
   Dim b() As Byte
   b = sText
   ReDim Preserve b(0 to Ubound(b) + 2) As Byte
   getStringPtr = VarPtr(b(0))
   ' No good!  b(0) goes out of scope here
End Function
</pre><p>
You either need to move the <i>getStringPtr</i> function into
the <i>DrawText</i> function or make <i>getStringPtr</i> work
on an array of bytes within a scope that includes anything
that calls it: which of course might destroy any generic purpose of such
a function...
</p></div></li><li><strong>Pointers, Buffers, Other Problems</strong><br /><p>
Many of the GDI+ functions take pointers to structures as input.  Often,
these have variable length input, and structures include pointers to 
structures or even just buffers in memory.
</p><p>
Such things are not impossible to use in VB, they just tend to make
life more difficult. For example, consider setting up the parameters
to the JPEG GDI+ Image Codec prior to saving a file to JPEG.
The Platform SDK definitions for this function are as follows:
</p><pre>
class EncoderParameters
{
public:
    // Number of parameters in this structure
    UINT Count;                   
    // Parameter values    
    EncoderParameter Parameter[1];
};

class EncoderParameter
{
public:
    // GUID of the parameter
    GUID    Guid;
    // Number of the parameter values 
    ULONG   NumberOfValues;
    // Value type, like ValueTypeLONG  etc.
    ULONG   Type;
    // A pointer to the parameter values
    VOID*   Value;
};

GpStatus WINGDIPAPI
GdipSaveImageToFile(GpImage *image, GDIPCONST WCHAR* filename,
                    GDIPCONST CLSID* clsidEncoder,
                    GDIPCONST EncoderParameters* encoderParams);

</pre><p>
The pointer that gets passed as the encoderParams needs to be
a structure in memory containing first a long variable
containing count, followed by an array of <i>EncoderParameter</i>
structures (which, despite the misleading <i>[1]</i> count in the declare, can
be of any length you want).  The next issue is that the
data type of the information contained by an <i>EncoderParameter</i> 
structure is arbitrary depending on the particular encoder you're
using - it could be an array of long values, a single float value
and so on.  In memory, this must be laid out as a pointer to the
memory.  This leads to a thorny coding problem in VB and in the
Type Library: how do you declare the parameters you're going to
pass if you don't know how may of them there are or anything about
how their data is laid out in memory?  You can't take advantage of
anything that helps you do it in VB, such as Variants, since the C
library was not written using these structures.
</p><p>
There are no standard answers to these kinds of questions.  The only
real way around them is to work out what would be expected in
memory and build it up as best you can, using a combination of 
structures and memory allocations as required.  In the case
of the function above, you can find the resulting code in 
the GDIPlusWrapper library in the <i>GDIPImage</i> class <i>Save</i> 
function.  It takes advantage of two functions provided by GDI+ to
make it easier to allocate and free memory buffers for use with GDI+:
</p><pre>
Private Declare Function GdipAlloc Lib "gdiplus.dll" ( _
   ByVal size As Long) As Long
Private Declare Function GdipFree Lib "gdiplus.dll" ( _
   ByVal ptr As Long) As Long
</pre></li></ul><h2>Sample Usage</h2><p>
This sample demonstrates how to load a PNG file and then draw it,
scaled to half size onto a PictureBox.  To run it, start a new VB project,
reference the GDI+ Type Library and the GDIPlusWrapper.DLL, add a PictureBox
to the form and set the <i>AutoRedraw</i> property to True.  Then add this
code to a Command Button, and modify the "C:\TestImage.png" to 
point to some actual graphics file on your system.
