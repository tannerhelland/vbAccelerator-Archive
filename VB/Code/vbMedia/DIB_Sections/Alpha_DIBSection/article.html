with per-pixel alpha.  The alpha component of a pixel allows you to determine how transparent
you would like a pixel to be.  This concept is being increasingly used in the Windows UI to
enhance the user experience with accurately blended drop-shadows and partially transparent objects.
</p><p>Note that system alpha-blending is not available on Win95 or NT.  If you want to display an
alpha-image on these systems you have use your own code routine to implement 
<span class="code">AlphaBlend</span>.  Sample code is provided to do this.</p><h2>Introduction to Alpha </h2><p>A bitmap consists of a array of bytes which reflect the image colours.  In early computer
days, little memory was available for the storage of images (in
fact, my first computer was so challenged this way it couldn't even fill more than 
30% of the display before running out of memory) and so the number of bits allocated to 
each pixel was reduced.  So if you allocate 1 bit per pixel, you can have two colours: on or off.
If you allocate 4 bits, you can have 16 combinations, hence 16 colours, and 
if you allow 1 byte then you can have 256 colours and so on.</p><p>Now that memory is cheap, and graphics cards typically have more memory on board 
than servers which ran an entire department used to have when I was a lad, more memory can be
allocated to an image.  Psychological studies have demonstrated that the number of colours
you require before two adjacent shades with only one-bit change in colour value are 
indistinguisable is somewhere in the millions.  This means that you never need more than
24 bits to store a colour value (24 bits is 16,777,216 different colours), which is why
24-bit displays are often referred to as "True Color".  However, computers
are typically organised in Word sizes of 32-bits or above.  Its easier to access memory when 
it is aligned to the word size of the computer, since you can read the block in one go. One
way of usefully using the additional 8 bits is to store an alpha value.
(I would expect bigger graphics colour sizes to appear as computer word sizes increase, perhaps 
this will allow for more accurate alpha and pixel math).</p><p>The idea of an alpha channel is it stores how transparent a given pixel should be, from 0 (completely
transparent) to 255 (completely opaque).  Once this concept is in place it becomes easier to create
much more sophisticated displays, in particular it allows for colour-accurate drop-shadows and 
smoothing of anti-aliased edges against any background.</p><h2>The GDI Alpha Functions</h2><p>Whilst GDI has supported 32bit DIB Sections for some time, it was not until "MsImg32.DLL"
was added to the OS in Windows 98 and 2000 that there was any built-in support for actually
drawing an image and applying alpha.  Similar functionality is also provided through the
<a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=2946">Layering API functions</a>, although these do not appear in 9x systems.</p><p>MsImg32.DLL introduces a function for drawing bitmaps with alpha channels, called 
<span class="code">AlphaBlend</span>.  There's also a <span class="code">TransparentBlt</span> function 
that works the same as <span class="code">&gt;BitBlt</span> but allows you to specify the colour 
that should be rendered transparently, although doing that is fairly easy using 
<a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=1387">Raster Operations</a>.
(<span class="code">TransparentBlt</span> also has a terrible GDI leak under Win9x/ME.
How rubbish is that?  Avoid it at all costs.)</p><p><span class="code">AlphaBlend</span> can basically be used in two ways:</p><ul><li>Drawing an entire bitmap with a constant alpha (transparency).</li><li>Drawing by merging individual alpha pixel components in the source or destination.</li></ul><h3>Drawing Bitmaps With Constant Alpha</h3><p>This way is the simplest, and is demonstrated in the "Simple Alpha Sample" 
download. To draw a picture with 50% transparency over another,
just start a VB project, add two PictureBoxes, set <span class="code">AutoRedraw</span> to true for each and 
place images into them. Then add this code:</p><pre>
Private Type BLENDFUNCTION
  BlendOp As Byte
  BlendFlags As Byte
  SourceConstantAlpha As Byte
  AlphaFormat As Byte
End Type
' BlendOp:
Private Const AC_SRC_OVER = &amp;H0
' AlphaFormat:
Private Const AC_SRC_ALPHA = &amp;H1

Private Declare Sub CopyMemory Lib "kernel32" Alias "RtlMoveMemory" ( _
    lpvDest As Any, lpvSource As Any, ByVal cbCopy As Long)

Private Declare Function AlphaBlend Lib "MSIMG32.dll" ( _
  ByVal hdcDest As Long, _
  ByVal nXOriginDest As Long, _
  ByVal nYOriginDest As Long, _
  ByVal nWidthDest As Long, _
  ByVal nHeightDest As Long, _
  ByVal hdcSrc As Long, _
  ByVal nXOriginSrc As Long, _
  ByVal nYOriginSrc As Long, _
  ByVal nWidthSrc As Long, _
  ByVal nHeightSrc As Long, _
  ByVal lBlendFunction As Long _
) As Long

Private Sub Form_Paint()
   Dim lBlend As Long
   Dim bf As BLENDFUNCTION

   ' Draw the first picture:
   bf.BlendOp = AC_SRC_OVER
   bf.BlendFlags = 0
   bf.SourceConstantAlpha = 255
   bf.AlphaFormat = 0
   CopyMemory lBlend, bf, 4
   AlphaBlend Me.hDC, 0, 0, _
      Picture1.ScaleWidth \ Screen.TwipsPerPixelX, _
      Picture1.ScaleHeight \ Screen.TwipsPerPixelY, _
      Picture1.hDC, 0, 0, _
      Picture1.ScaleWidth \ Screen.TwipsPerPixelX, _
      Picture1.ScaleHeight \ Screen.TwipsPerPixelY, _
      lBlend

   ' Now draw the second picture with 50% transparency over the top:
   bf.SourceConstantAlpha = 128
   CopyMemory lBlend, bf, 4
   AlphaBlend Me.hDC, 0, 0, _
      Picture2.ScaleWidth \ Screen.TwipsPerPixelX, _
      Picture2.ScaleHeight \ Screen.TwipsPerPixelY, _
      Picture2.hDC, 0, 0, _
      Picture2.ScaleWidth \ Screen.TwipsPerPixelX, _
      Picture2.ScaleHeight \ Screen.TwipsPerPixelY, _
      lBlend
   
End Sub
</pre><p>The download also demonstrates how to do this without using the <span class="code">AlphaBlend</span>
function with the <span class="code">cAlphaDibSection</span> class.  This would be useful if you're
trying to implement drawing with Alpha on pre Win98 or NT systems.</p><h3>Drawing Bitmaps with Per-Pixel Alpha</h3><p>If you have a bitmap with an alpha-channel, that is, 32 bits/pixel, then you
can draw the picture using the alpha contained within it quite easily.  There
is only one catch, which is an annoying element of the working with the <span class="code">AlphaBlend</span>
function.  When you use <span class="code">AlphaBlend</span> to draw bitmaps with individual alpha
pixel components, the red, green and blue components must be pre-multiplied with
the alpha amount.  So if for example a pixel is mid-grey and has a transparency around 25% (alpha = 64),
then rather than the values being:</p><pre>
   Red = 128
   Green = 128
   Blue = 128
   Alpha = 64
</pre><p>The values actually need to be:</p><pre>
   Red = 128 * (64/255) = 32
   Green = 128 * (64/255) = 32
   Blue = 128 * (64/255) = 32
   Alpha = 64
</pre><p>See the MSDN documentation for <span class="code">BLENDFUNCTION</span> and the related code 
sample "Alpha Blending a Bitmap". The other minor issue is that you have no way of 
changing the alpha channel; 
this may or may not be a problem depending on what you're trying to achieve.</p><p>Assuming you have a bitmap in the correct format (alphalogo.bmp in the main download is suitable for
this) then the simple way to draw it is as follows.  To run this you need to create a PictureBox
on the main form with <i>AutoRedraw</i> and <i>AutoSize</i> set True.</p><pre>

</pre><p>If you actually want to create your own alpha images, or modify their alpha as
the application runs, then you need a more powerful structure.  The 
<span class="code">cAlphaDibSection</span> class provided with the downloads enables this.</p><h2>cAlphaDibSection</h2><p>The <span class="code">cAlphaDibSection</span> class provides a wrapper to a 32-bit DIB section
which you can use to create, draw and manipulate per-pixel alpha images at will.
The methods and properties of this object are the same as the 
<a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=3017">cDIBSection class</a>, 
except an <span class="code">AlphaPaintPicture</span> method has been added to allow you to draw
the picture with Alpha-blending.</p><p>As an example of how to manipulate an image using this wrapper, here's a 
function which will take a VB StdPicture as input and return a version of
it which fades to transparency towards the right-hand side:</p><pre>

</pre><h2>About The Demonstration Project</h2><p>The demonstration project shows how to create a per-pixel alpha image at run-time
from an image and a mask, and demonstrates displaying it over various backgrounds
and with differing amounts of overall transparency.  There is also a sample of
a button type control which uses the alpha-channel information within the DIB
to determine whether the button has been hit, as well as how to create a disabled
image or to change the colour theme of the bitmap at runtime.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p></td><td class="rightbar" valign="top" bgcolor="#C2BEB1">
