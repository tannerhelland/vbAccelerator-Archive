As hard disk sizes increase, the requirement to perform lossy compression on 
digital audio files is reducing.  This article looks at some of the code available
to perform lossless compression of WAV files and demonstrates how to encode and
decode files in VB using Monkey's Audio Compressor.
</p><h2>On Lossless Compression</h2><p>
Compressing audio data without losing information is a difficult task to do well.
Unlike text documents and image diagrams, there are often few short-length repetitive
features in an audio waveform, which makes run-length encoding less than effective.
For this reason most popular audio compression formats such as MP3, Atrac 
and WMx use psycho-acoustic principles to remove information which in theory the ear 
cannot hear anyway.  These formats work like JPG image files and are lossy 
so that repeatedly encoding, decoding then re-encoding the same data will result 
in progessive quality loss.  
</p><p>
There are some features of audio data which indicate
that some compression is possible.  Firstly, in a stereo waveform, there 
is often a strong correlation between the data in the two channels.  Secondly, 
musical audio data is rarely random, and neighbouring samples are usually closer together 
than the entire range of the sample (here we are ignoring some of the output of artists
like Kid606 and Girltalk):
</p><img src="CarlyVsGirlTalk.html" width="254" height="152" alt="Carly Simon vs GirlTalk" /><p class="caption">0.3s of audio data compared: Top waveform is the chorus of Carly Simon's "You're So Vain", Bottom is Girltalk's "Tony Bennett Could Never Write My Theme Music Because He's A Pussy"</p><p>The reasons for these correlations arise from the way human hearing works 
and how that relates to the frequency of a sound:
</p><ol><li>Because ears are relatively closely spaced and the waveform for low notes
is at a low frequency, it is not possible to make a spacial determination of the source
of bass notes.  For this reason audio systems can often get by with a single speaker for 
deep bass.  In most recordings the lower frequencies will tend to be 
correlated across all channels; this also helps to prevent anti-phase problems
where the bass from one channel cancels the bass from another out.  Instruments and
parts which should appear at the centre of a stereo recording will have identical
components in each channel.</li><li>The ear is less responsive to low frequencies than mid-frequency ones. Hence the
amplitude of a low frequency waveform needs to be greater than one for a mid frequency
waveform.  This often results in portions of audio waveforms having the appearance of a large sine
wave with smaller noise components applied over the top.  The noise components perturb
the overall amplitude but most often by far less than the entire range.  
</li></ol><p>
It's not easy though.  Firstly, even though typically
there are small changes, sometimes the changes are much less small, as you can see from
these two waveforms; both are from electro tunes, and despite appearances the second is
actually much less hardcore than the first:
</p><img src="easyCompress.png" width="267" height="237" alt="'Easy to compress' samples" /><p class="caption">'Easy' to compress Wave Samples: adjacent samples are close and stereo samples are
correlated.</p><img src="hardCompress.png" width="267" height="237" alt="Hard to compress samples" /><p class="caption">Harder to compress Wave Samples with more than 50% difference between adjacent samples 
and reduced stereo correlation.</p><p>
Secondly, in any digital system, removing
1-bit halves the number of values which can be represented.  So a 10% change in a 16bit
signal still requires 13 bits to represent, which is only 19% compression.  Therefore a naive
scheme, which requires all changes to be &lt;= +/-5%, would not do particularly well in
compressing a file.  The chances of all changes fitting this criteria are unfortunately
slight, so it not only doesn't compress very well, it probably doesn't work either.
</p><p>
More intelligent compression is possible.  Techniques which use an intelligent tagging scheme to 
encode deltas and use some form of predictive techniques can be put together
that achieve around 40 - 45% compression.  At the end of 2004, a standard which uses
a predictive entropy-based encoding scheme is going to be added to MP4.  Until then, 
however, there are a variety of other 
options, the main candidates being:
</p><ol><li><strong>Matthew T Ashland's <a href="http://www.monkeysaudio.com/">Monkey's Audio</a></strong><br />
At the time of writing, this appears to achieve the best compression. Source
and easy to use SDK are provided, but it has a difficult licence (see later for more).</li><li><strong>Conifer Software's <a href="http://www.wavpack.com/">WavPack</a></strong><br />
Source available and free to use; compression about 4% off Monkey's Audio.
</li><li><strong><a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/">FLAC</a> (Free Lossless Audio Codec)</strong><br />
Open-source and free to use; compression better than WavPack but not as good as Monkey's Audio.
</li><li><strong>SoftSound's <a href="http://www.softsound.com/">Shorten</a></strong><br />
Used in a number of professional products, however source not easily available.
</li></ol><p>
The following sample looks at using the SDK available for from Monkey's Audio site.
</p><h2>On Monkey's Audio</h2><p>
Monkey's Audio is one of the most effective compression algorithms currently available both
in compression ratios and implementation efficiency.
Its also quite a lot of fun, mainly thanks to a cool SDK, a pervading Monkey theme and some
fun about "PolkaMonkey" in which the author
suggests he has discovered a way to perform 10:1 lossless audio compression, but he 
can't provide any details because...
</p><p>
The licence to Monkey's audio is also rather amusing.  Unusually, it 
actually prohibits use of the software provided in the downloads
without first obtaining express written permission from the author to do so, 
assuming that Windows can be described as a "program". Even if you
don't regard Windows as a program, then it's hard to see how using the provided Winamp
plugin within, erm, Winamp does not represent "using the software
in another program".  More unusually, if you agree to the licence then you 
also agree that "all rights not expressly granted here are reserved by 
Matthew T. Ashland".  I'm not sure 
what Mr. Ashland will do with my rights to a fair trial, privacy and 
so on but now they are reserved by him. I do hope he's not the death penalty type.
</p><p>
Anyway, I believe the intention is that if you intend to use the software 
for any use other than personal or educational you need to obtain permission first.
These kinds of licence terms also mean you should consider before using the format 
for anything. For example, you may, like me, own digital audio media which 
is around 12 years old.  One would hope 12 years from now that you could still 
use such media, but this may not be the case for MAC files. For example, if you find the
supplied software is inappropriate or does not run on a 
particular machine you may not be granted a licence to do anything about it, 
consigning any data you might have using the format to digital hell (it can then join 
anything else you've got that happens to include DRM, since even if it isn't purposefully designed 
to self-destruct just when you think you might be half liking it, then you'll probably make a tiny
mistake during a machine upgrade or it'll crash and you'll never *ever* be able to access it again).  In 
the case of Carly Simon's "You're So Vain" that might not prove to be such a problem; but
nevertheless...
</p><p>
A future update of this article is going to look at FLAC instead because the licence
agreement is more amenable.
</p><h2>Using Monkey's Audio</h2><p>
Monkey's Audio file format supports compression, decompression, file verification and MP3 ID3v1 tags.
The compression, decompression and verification functions are available in two flavours: 
a streaming flavour, which allows you to source each block of audio data for 
compression/decompression and then pass it into the algorithm, and a callback type, which operates
on files and allows you to display a progress bar and cancel the operation.  The callback style
is simpler to use so I've used that for this sample.  It also kindly runs on a background thread
and pumps messages through the message loop so that the application stays responsive whilst 
processing is being performed.
</p><p>
To see how it works, I'll briefly cover implementing compression using the MAC API.  To
compress a file using the simple API needs only a single API declare:
</p><pre>
Private Declare Function CompressFile Lib "macdll" ( _
      ByVal pInputFile As Long, _
      ByVal pOutputFile As Long, _
      ByVal nCompressionLevel As Long, _
      ByRef pPercentageDone As Long, _
      ByVal pfnProgressCallback As Long, _
      ByRef pKillFlag As Long) As Long
</pre><p>
The parameters are as follows:
</p><table class="article"><tr class="header"><td><strong>Parameter</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td><span class="code">pInputFile</span></td><td>The file to compress, as a pointer to a null-terminated array of ASCII bytes</td></tr><tr><td><span class="code">pOutputFile</span></td><td>The ouput file, as a pointer to a null-terminated array of ASCII bytes</td></tr><tr><td><span class="code">nCompressionLevel</span></td><td>One of the MAC compression levels:
<ul><li>COMPRESSION_LEVEL_FAST = 1000</li><li>COMPRESSION_LEVEL_NORMAL = 2000</li><li>COMPRESSION_LEVEL_HIGH = 3000</li><li>COMPRESSION_LEVEL_EXTRA_HIGH = 4000</li></ul>
Setting compression to high or extra high will provide a slightly smaller output
file, but increases the processing needed to read and write the compressed file.
</td></tr><tr><td><span class="code">pPercentageDone</span></td><td>A pointer to a long variable which is updated with the percentage complete as
compression is performed.</td></tr><tr><td><span class="code">pfnProgressCallback</span></td><td>A pointer to a function which is called as compression is performed.  The
function which is called must be a subroutine with a single long parameter
which contains the percentage complete:
<p><span class="code">Private Sub ProgressCallback(ByVal nPercentageDone As Long)</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><span class="code">pKillFlag</span></td><td>A pointer to a long variable which is polled at intervals to check whether
processing should be stopped.  When this variable is set to 0 (false) the 
processing continues; if set to 1 (true) then the processing is stopped.</td></tr></table><p>
Implementing the API therefore requires a module to hold the function to
callback to (unless you were to implement this using a thunk) and some code
to call the routine and maintain the two variables which are pointed to
whilst an operation is in progress.  In this sample, all the calls to the MAC API
are wrapped into the class <span class="i">cMACAudioSimple</span> with a
supporting module <span class="i">mMACAudio</span>.  These variables are therefore
declared in the class:
</p><pre>
' Pointer to the callback function
Private m_lPtrProgress As Long
' Long value to maintain the kill state
Private m_pKillFlag As Long
' Long value to maintain percentage done
Private m_pPercentDone As Long
' Whether an operation is in progress or not
Private m_bOperationInProgress As Boolean

' Variables to allow file names and compression levels to
' be set through properties:
Private m_sFileNameApe As String
Private m_sFileNameWav As String
Private m_eCompressionLevel As EMacCompressionLevel
</pre><p>
The next part is to compress the file.  When you call the API compress
method, the VB code appears to stop executing at that point until
compression is complete; however, since the call pumps messages through
the message loop the UI stays responsive and other code in the application
can be run.  The code for compression therefore looks like this:
</p><pre>
Public Function Compress() As Boolean

   If (m_bOperationInProgress) Then
      ' Do not allow multiple operations:
      pErr 3, False
      Exit Function
   End If

   ' Check input file exists:
   If (FileExists(m_sFileNameApe)) Then    
      pErr 2, False
   Else
      ' Check output file does not exist:
      If Not (FileExists(m_sFileNameWav)) Then
         pErr 1, False
      Else
      
         ' Indicate an operation is in progress
         m_bOperationInProgress = True
         ' Set up the callback pointer:
         mMACAudio.MACAudio = Me
         
         ' Initialise percent done/kill flag
         m_pPercentDone = 0
         m_pKillFlag = 0
         
         ' Convert file names to arrays of ASCII bytes:
         Dim bFileIn() As Byte
         bFileIn = StrConv(m_sFileNameWav, vbFromUnicode)
         ReDim Preserve bFileIn(0 To UBound(bFileIn) + 1) As Byte
         Dim bFileOut() As Byte
         bFileOut = StrConv(m_sFileNameApe, vbFromUnicode)
         ReDim Preserve bFileOut(0 To UBound(bFileOut) + 1) As Byte
                  
         ' Compress the file:
         Dim lR As Long
         lR = CompressFile(VarPtr(bFileIn(0)), VarPtr(bFileOut(0)), _
            m_eCompressionLevel, _
            m_pPercentDone, m_lPtrProgress, m_pKillFlag)
         If Not (lR = 0) Then
            If Not (lR = ERROR_USER_STOPPED_PROCESSING) Then
               pErr lR, True
            End If
         Else
            Compress = True
         End If
         
         m_bOperationInProgress = False
         RaiseEvent Complete
      End If
   End If

End Function
</pre><p>
Setting up the callback pointer is achieved this code in the module:
</p><pre>
Private m_c As cMACAudioSimple

Public Property Let MACAudio(c As cMACAudioSimple)
   Set m_c = c
   m_c.SetProgressCallbackPtr AddressOf ProgressCallback
End Property

Private Sub ProgressCallback(ByVal nPercentageDone As Long)
   '
   m_c.ProgressCallback nPercentageDone
   '
End Sub
</pre><p>
And this code in the class to action the callback:
</p><pre>
Friend Sub ProgressCallback(ByVal nPercentageDone As Long)
   '
   Dim bCancel As Boolean
   bCancel = False
   ' Note percent done is stored as a long between 0 and 1E5:
   RaiseEvent Progress(nPercentageDone / 100000#, bCancel)
   If (bCancel) Then
      m_pKillFlag = 1
   End If
   '
End Sub
</pre><p>
With this in place, client code can compress files through
a handful of calls to the class:
</p><pre>
Private WithEvents m_cMACAudio As cMACAudioSimple

Private Sub Compress( _
      ByVal sWavFile As String, _
      ByVal sApeFile As String, _
      ByVal eCompression As EMacCompressionLevel _
   )
   m_cMACAudio.CompressionLevel = eCompression
   m_cMACAudio.WavFileName = sWavFile 
   m_cMACAudio.ApeFileName = sApeFile 
   m_cMACAudio.Compress
End Sub

Private Sub m_cMACAudio_Progress( _
       ByVal nPercentDone As Single, _
       bCancel As Boolean)
   '
   ' Show progress and set bCancel flag if needed here
   '
End Sub
</pre><p>
The only thing to note is that you should make sure that any operation in progress
is cancelled prior to closing the application.   The sample application also
includes code for decompression, verification and getting/setting the ID3 tag
associated with the APE file.
</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
This article has taken a look at some lossless wave compression samples and provides a 
sample implementation using Monkey's Audio.
