to use FreeDB's CD look-up service to retrieve artist, title and track listing information for 
the CD.  Along the way it describes some of the alternatives and pitfalls.</p><h2>About the Sample</h2><p>Before diving into the detail of how and why everything works, first you might want
to have a look at the sample code.  Before you start, you need to:</p><ul><li>Make sure you have ASPI installed.  If you have a CD Burning utility, such as <a href="http://www.nero.com/">Nero</a>
then its likely that ASPI will be installed.  If not, you will want to go to the <a href="http://www.adaptec.com/">Adaptec</a>
site and download ASPI.  You can find it there by choosing Downloads and searching for "ASPI" then
downloading the latest version.  Make sure that the ASPI DLL (WNASPI32.DLL) is copied to your System directory before
starting.</li><li>Copy ASPIShim.DLL from the download into your System directory.  This is a Win32 DLL so it doesn't need registering.</li></ul><p>Now you're ready to try the code.  When you run the sample, the drives combo box will be populated with 
the available drives on the system.  In this version, only the SCSI hardware adaptor, device ID and Logical Device Unit (LUN)
are shown for the drives.  In a future update, I'll add code to look up the drive letter and drive description using
the registry (or the equivalent <i>DeviceIOControl</i> call under NT).  If a drive containing a CD is selected, the 
TOC will be read and populated into the listbox, and at the same time the query to post to FreeDB is generated.
If you click the "Get Details" button the sample will connect to FreeDB and download the artist, title
and track listing asynchrononously.</p><h3>Provided classes</h3><p>The following classes in the sample are provided for re-use:</p><ul><li><strong>cCDDrives</strong><br />
This class uses ASPI to generate a list of CD Drives on the system.  For each CD Drive you can 
retrieve the <i>HostAdaptor</i>, <i>ID</i>, <i>LUN</i> and the <i>TOC</i> object, which returns
a <i>cCDToc</i> instance.</li><li><strong>cCDToc</strong><br />
This class contains a table of contents for the selected CD (if present).  From this object you
can get the following:
<ol><li><i>NoCD</i>: True if no CD in the drive, False otherwise.</li><li><i>TrackCount</i>: Count of tracks on the CD.</li><li><i>TrackOffset(track)</i>: The offset, in frames (a CD frame is 1/75 of a second) of the track from the start of the CD.</li><li><i>TrackLengthMinutes(track)</i>: The Minutes portion of the length of the track.</li><li><i>TrackLengthSeconds(track)</i>: The Seconds portion of the length of the track.</li><li><i>TrackLengthFrames(track)</i>: The Frames portion of the length of the track.</li><li><i>LeadOut...</i>: The Offset and Minutes/Seconds/Frames of the lead out of the CD.</li><li><i>TrackType(track)</i>: Whether the track is an audio or data track.</li><li><i>TotalLengthSeconds</i>: The total length of the Audio CD In seconds.</li><li><i>CDDBId</i>: The CDDB DiscID for this CD.</li><li><i>CDDBQuery</i>: A string containing the query to pass to FreeDB.</li></ol></li><li><strong>cFreeDb</strong><br />
A class which wraps up access to FreeDb using HTTP.
<ol><li><i>Server</i>: The FreeDB server to connect to. Defaults to "http://freedb.freedb.org/".</li><li><i>Url</i>: The URL on the FreeDB server which implements the CDDB service. Defaults to "~cddb/cddb.cgi".</li><li><i>UserName</i>: The name which will be passed to FreeDB in the hello command.</li><li><i>UserHost</i>: The hostname which will be passed to FreeDB in the hello command.</li><li><i>AgentName</i>: The name of the application which will be passed to FreeDB.</li><li><i>AgentVersion</i>: The version of the application which will be passed to FreeDB.</li><li><i>Command</i>: The FreeDB command to execute.</li><li><i>Start</i>: Submits the command to FreeDB and waits for a response.  When the response is received, the
<i>CommandReady</i> event will be fired.</li><li><i>Abort</i>: Aborts any command which is in progress.</li><li><i>CommandSubmitted</i>: Whether a command has been submitted to FreeDB and is in progress.</li><li><i>Response</i>: The (unparsed) response from FreeDB to a successful request.</li></ol>
There are also two properties which can be used to parse the response to the query or the read command 
into classes with the fields ready to read:
<ol><li><i>QueryResponse</i>: Returns a <i>cFreeDbQueryResponse</i> object containing the details of the query command response.</li><li><i>ReadResponse</i>: Returns a <i>cFreeDbReadResponse</i> object containing the details of the read command response.</li></ol></li></ul><h2>Getting Track-Lists from CDs: An Overview</h2><p>You will probably already have seen track-list download functionality in other music applications such
as <a href="http://www.winamp.com/">WinAmp</a>, <a href="http://www.musicmatch.com/">MusicMatch</a> and many others.  
When you insert a CD, and you're connected to the Internet, the application downloads the
CD's artist, title and track list, allowing you to see the track names for the CD.</p><p>Most commercial applications use the <a href="http://www.gracenote.com/">Gracenote CDDB</a> to achieve
this functionality.  This is easy to use, but unfortunately for almost any distribution you require a
licence, which is both costly and restrictive.  Luckily there is a completely free alternative service 
which also maintains a comprehensive database of CD track information at <a href="http://www.freedb.org/">FreeDb.org</a>.
This is an open-source service running under the LPGL licence and there are numerous freeware and shareware 
music players out there which use its facilities, which keeps the database strong.</p><p>So what do you need to do to use FreeDB?  The complete technical details of their service are posted on 
the site, but basically you need to do two things:</p><ol><li>Generate a <i>DiscID</i> from the CD</li><li>Send a request to FreeDb.org for the specified disc, and read the results.</li></ol><p>I'll cover these in turn.</p><h2>1. Generating a <i>DiscID</i></h2><h3>1.1 DiscID Calculation</h3><p>CDs themselves do not generally have any useful unique identifier which you can use to identify
the CD. For this reason various algorithms have been developed which attempt to generate a unique
id based on the contents of the CD itself.  The FreeDB.org disc ID is generated from the CD's Table
of Contents (TOC), the number of tracks on the CD and the total length of the CD.  The algorithm
in pseudo code is like this:</p><pre>
Function DiscID() As Long
     tocSum = 0
     For Each track in CDTOC
        tocSum = tocSum + AddDigits(track.PositionInSeconds)
     Next

     firstLastSum = CDTOC.track(0).PositionInSeconds
     firstLastSum = firstLastSum - CDTOC.leadOut.PositionInSeconds

     DiscId = ((tocSum and &amp;HFF)&gt;&gt;24) Or ((firstLastSum)&gt;&gt;8) Or CDTOC.NumTracks
End Function

Function AddDigits(position)
    addDigits = 0
    Do While (position &gt; 0)
       addDigits = addDigits + (position Mod 10)
       position = position \ 10
    Loop
End Function
</pre><p>The &gt;&gt; operator is a Right-Shift which basically shifts the bits up by the specified
number; so for example (tocSum and &amp;HFF)&gt;&gt;24 will move the first 8 bits of tocSum (since
we and with &amp;HFF) from positions 0-7 in the long to positions 24-31.</p><p>Implementing this algorithm is not too hard, although you have to be careful in VB because
the DiscID needs to be calculated using <i>unsigned</i> arithmetic.  In VB, long values are
signed, which means the high-bit (bit 31) is used to work out if the number is positive or 
negative.  If you just used VB's + operator, then you can end up with an incorrect result.  The
download code demonstrates how to perform unsigned addition and shifting correctly.</p><h3>1.2 Getting a CD's TOC</h3><p>In order to actually perform the calculation, you see you need the Table of Contents (TOC)
for the CD. There are three possible ways of doing this, with varying levels of difficulty:</p><ol><li><strong>Using MCI</strong><br />
The MCI interface can be used to provide a list of CD contents.  However, this method is not
good for calculating DiscIDs because it only returns a TOC for audio tracks on the CD.  If the CD
is mixed, and has both audio and data tracks, then the resulting DiscID calculation is incorrect.
The advantage of using it is it is simple to implement.</li><li><strong>Using the Advanced SCSI Programming Interface (ASPI)</strong><br />
ASPI is a technology provided by Adaptec for Win32 systems.  Although it refers to SCSI this appears
to be a misnomer as it works fine with IDE drives on the system too; it is probably there for legacy
reasons.  This interface is available for all Win32 OS versions.</li><li><strong>Using <i>DeviceIOCtl</i></strong><br />
NT/2000/XP systems provide the <i>DeviceIOCtl</i> API which allows you perform SCSI passthrough requests
to devices. The disadvantage to using this method is firstly there is no equivalent for Win 9x/SE/ME and
secondly you need to be able to open the CD drive for shared reading.  If any other application is using
the CD you can't do this, whereas ASPI allows querying even when the CD is being used elsewhere.</li></ol><p>In order to provide code which works on all OS, I've implemented this example using ASPI.  The first 
thing to note about ASPI is that you can't call ASPI functions directly from VB.  Although the API
looks straightforward (erm, well, reasonable) all of the calls have been exported using the <i>_cdecl</i>
calling convention rather than the <i>_stdcall</i> convention which is supported by VB.  This means
that you although you can declare the functions in VB when you try to call them you get
Run-time Error 49 ("Bad DLL Calling Convention").</p><p>There is a 
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q153586">Knowledge
Base</a> article on this if you're interested in the details (which also provides
the bizarre snippet of information that VB actually can succeed in making calls
to _cdecl DLLs but only when the application is compiled into an executable, and
that this is apparently a bug!).</p><p>To work around this you need to create a Win32 DLL which just wraps the _cdecl
calls with _stdcall equivalents.  Luckily, there is a free-source (LGPL) <a href="http://www.hochfeiler.it/alvise/aspi_VB.htm">wrapper
DLL</a> called ASPIShim.DLL which was written by Jon F. Zohornacky and posted 
at Alvise Valsecchi's <a href="http://www.hochfeiler.it/alvise/">Web site</a>.  This DLL simply wraps
the ASPI API calls with <i>_stdcall</i> exported versions.</p><h2>2. Sending Requests to FreeDB.org</h2><p>FreeDB itself exposes its API across the internet in two ways: firstly, as a TCP/IP interface
and secondly as a HTTP version.  Whilst the TCP/IP version allows stateful connections and probably some
small performance improvements, the HTTP version is used here.  The main reasons for this were:</p><ol><li>The HTTP interface works on Port 80 using text only, hence firewalls are unlikely to be a problem</li><li>Can leverage the MSXML3 <i>ServerXMLHTTP</i> object to easily send and receive data across HTTP.</li></ol><p>There are a variety of FreeDB services, however the default (random server selection) can be found at</p><p>http://freedb.freedb.org/~cddb/cddb.cgi</p><p>This responds to either GET or POST requests for the specified command; both interfaces are identical
except that the POST request takes the command as the body of the request whereas the GET request uses
the URL's get parameters.  Using GET is simpler and is the method adopted here.  The GET request takes
three parameters:</p><ol><li><i>cmd</i> - The command to execute, with spaces converted to + signs</li><li><i>hello</i> - The parameters to the CDDB hello command separated by + signs.</li><li><i>proto</i> - Which version of the CDDB protocol to use (1 - 5).</li></ol><p>A complete list of all the commands you can issue to the server, and the responses, is provided 
at the freedb website under the Developers section.  The articles you need are the "CDDB-protocol
documentation" and the "Database-format specification".

<p>As an example, however, the "cddb read" command is used to get the track listing
for a CD with a specified genre and a specified DiscId.  The command is as follows:</p><pre>
   cddb read genre discid
</pre>

To issue a cddb read command for <a href="http://www.invictahifi.co.uk/ladytron">Ladytron's</a> 604 album, 
which has a DiscID of <i>d90c9510</i> and a genre of "misc" (ho hum) you send this:</p><p><a href="http://freedb.freedb.org/~cddb/cddb.cgi?cmd=cddb+read+misc+d90c9510&amp;hello=name+host.com+appname+1.0&amp;proto=1">http://freedb.freedb.org/~cddb/cddb.cgi?cmd=cddb+read+misc+d90c9510&amp;hello=name+host.com+appname+1.0&amp;proto=1</a></p><p>Note that name, host.com, appname and 1.0 specify details about you and the program you're using.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p></td><td class="rightbar" valign="top" bgcolor="#C2BEB1">
