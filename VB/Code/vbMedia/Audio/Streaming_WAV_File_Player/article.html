been safer not to mess with this anyway as the Platform SDK clearly states it is reserved, but
hindsight is a simple thing).  The new version fixes this problem by only copying the non-reserved

At the simplest level, 
there is the Multimedia Control Interface (MCI) control provided with VB. This is turn is a very 
thin wrapper around the MCI API provided with Win32, which offers about the same level of control for playing waves 
as the API  <i>PlaySound</i> and <i>sndPlaySound</i> functions.</p><p>At a deeper level, your application can take charge of reading chunks of audio from disk and streaming it 
directly to the sound card. The advantage of these methods is you get more control over how the audio is played, and
you can play audio files of arbitrary length without using all your memory.</p><h2>Playing Waves</h2><p>The main advantage of the deeper level methods is that with the MCI and PlaySound methods, the 
system has to allocate memory for the entire sound before it starts. With a streaming approach, 
you can read the sound in in small chunks (say 0.1s of audio) allowing you to play audio 
samples of any length (and remember that a CD quality stereo WAV file occupies around 10Mb/minute!). 
As demonstrated in the picture above, the streaming player works just fine on a 185Mb CD Quality 
wave file (some 18 minutes of 16 bit stereo at 44.1kHz).</p><p>Another advantage of using the multimedia methods is you can modify the sound before you play it. 
You could filter it by averaging the bytes before putting them into the sound card's buffer. 
Or you could create an echo effect by preparing an additional audio buffer which you save attenuated samples 
of the main sound to as it plays.  You can even create an audio synthesizer this way by creating
the waveform on the fly, although remember that the ear can discern timing to about 15ms accuracy, so 
you have to be careful with how large your buffers are.</p><h2>An Uncontrollable Lust for Power</h2><p>Using the multimedia API at this level gives you more control, but the downside is additional 
complexity. This sample demonstrates how you can play back standard .WAV files, however, if you 
need to be able to play back sounds which have are not directly compatible with your soundcard 
(for example, .WAV files with ADPCM compression or .MP3 files) then this sample alone will 
not work because it would need to invoke the Audio Compression Manager (ACM) functions to do that 
(which may or may not be the subject of a future article, depending on whether I can figure 
it out!).</p><h2>The cWavPlayer Class</h2><p>The <i>cWavPlayer</i> class supplied with the download wraps up access to stream digital audio to 
the sound card. Fundamentally, it works like this:</p><ul><li>OpenFile<br />
Opens a Multimedia IO device handle, reads the header of the WAV file to check the format 
of the WAV file and then creates a number of buffers to hold 0.1s each of the wave data read in from the file.</li><li>Play<br />
Creates a <i>WaveOut</i> handle for passing data to the soundcard from the WAV file and specifies 
that when data is needed by the soundcard it should post a message to the window. It then prepares 
each of the buffers to send data to the wave out handle and initiates the play callback loop by posting 
the message to the window.</li><li>Play callback loop<br />
Reads data from the file into the wave buffer pointed to by the wave header, and then writes it out 
to the sound card's driver. When the data is exhausted, the buffer is unprepared and finally once 
all the buffers have been unprepared the <i>WaveOut</i> handle is closed.</li></ul><p>Using the class as provided is straightforward. Add the class to your project, 
and ensure the project references <a href="article190a.html?id=17">SSubTmr.DLL</a>.  If you're using VB6, then note
that you should reference SSubTmr6.DLL and modify the code by replacing "SSubTimer." with
"SSubTimer6." (without the quotes).</p><p>Next open a .WAV file with the <i>OpenFile</i> method. At this stage you can read various information 
about the wave file, such as the sampling frequency (<i>SamplesPerSecond</i>), the bit depth (<i>BitsPerSample</i>), 
whether the file is stereo or mono (<i>Channels</i>).</p><p>To play the file, use the <i>Play</i> method. You can pause it at any time by choosing the 
<i>Stop</i> method, and change the position in the file using the <i>FileSeek</i> method.</p><p>You can get the position of the playback at any time using the <i>Position</i> method. 
Remember that with this class the audio is buffered.  There are five (<i>NUM_BUFFERS</i>) independent buffers
set up and each has a length of approximately 0.1s (<i>BUFFER_SECONDS</i>) of Audio.  This affects the 
position.</p><p>To reduce the latency associated
with the position and starting and stopping playback, you can modify the number of buffers and the length by changing
the constants in the class.  The amount they can be reduced 
really depends on the performance of the machine you're using, so in a real application you'd probably want these
to be configurable.  On an Athlon 2200XP with a stock soundcard, it is 
possible to operate with just two buffers and a 0.05s resolution, which really isn't bad at all.  
Note that latency is only really an issue if you're trying to accurately sync two sounds.  If both 
sounds are delayed by exactly the same latency, then there won't be any problem.</p><h2>Coincidentally</h2><p>The DJ Set playing in the picture above was part of a one-off DJ event on 14 Oct 2002 
inspired by the exceptional  <a href="http://www.2manydjs.org/">2 Many DJs</a> album "As Heard On 
Radio Soulwax Pt 2" played to a crowd of fashionable yet mainly middle-aged 
listeners at the BugBar in Brixton, London.
