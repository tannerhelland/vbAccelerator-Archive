Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 675 Mass Ave,
 Cambridge, MA 02139, USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
 copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

       Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
   share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
   intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
   make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public
   License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to
   any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free
   Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public
   License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
   General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
   to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
   wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
   can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
   you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
   deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
   restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
   copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
   for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You
   must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you
   must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
   offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
   and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
   everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If
   the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
   recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
   problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'
   reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
   wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
   individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
   proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
   licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
   follow.

      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
       DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
   placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
   of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such
   program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program
   or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
   containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter,
   translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) 
   Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
 this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
 not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
 contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
 made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program
 does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
   as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
   License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
   the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
 at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
   also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices    stating
     that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in    whole
     or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any    part thereof,
     to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third    parties under the
     terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively    when
     run, you must cause it, when started running for such    interactive use
     in the most ordinary way, to print or display an    announcement including
     an appropriate copyright notice and a    notice that there is no warranty
     (or else, saying that you provide    a warranty) and that users may
     redistribute the program under    these conditions, and telling the user
     how to view a copy of this    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself
     is interactive but    does not normally print such an announcement, your
     work based on    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
 sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
 considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
 and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
 separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
 which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on
 the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
 rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
 right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
 the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
 Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
 distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
 License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
   Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
   and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable    source
     code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections    1 and 2
     above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three    years, to
     give any third party, for a charge no more than your    cost of physically
     performing source distribution, a complete    machine-readable copy of the
     corresponding source code, to be    distributed under the terms of
     Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium    customarily used for software
     interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer    to
     distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is    allowed
     only for noncommercial distribution and only if you    received the
     program in object code or executable form with such    an offer, in accord
     with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
 modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
 the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
 definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
 installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source
 code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
 either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and
 so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
 component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
 code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even
 though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
 object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
   expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy,
   modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
   terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
   copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
    However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
   Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you
   do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
   Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
   this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
   distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
   the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
   copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
   conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
   exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
   compliance by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so
   as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
   other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
   the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
   directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
   it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
   Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
 the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
 other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
 section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
 distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
 people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
 distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
 distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
 choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
 consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
   copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
   that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
    In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
   body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
 version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
 that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
 Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
 you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
   whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
   permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
   Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
   exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
   promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

       NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
   THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
   OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
   OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM
   PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
   THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
