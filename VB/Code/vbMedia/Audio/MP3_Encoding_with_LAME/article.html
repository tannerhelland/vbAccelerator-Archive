The unfortunately named <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=14897">LAME 
(Lame Ain't an MP3 Encoder)</a> open source project is a highly-regarded source for creating MP3 files, which is used in a number of projects such as <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=14896">CDEx</a>.  This sample demonstrates using the encoding functions from VB 
to create MP3 files from WAV files.
</p><h2>C Hell</h2><p>
There are a couple of problems which make using LAME a little more tricky than
you might hope for if you're from a VB background.  The first is that LAME is
distributed as C source code only, although the code includes the source needed
to build a DLL.  This is partly for legal reasons, as using any MP3 encoding
technology in a piece of software may require a 
<a href="http://lame.sourceforge.net/links.html#patents">patent licence</a> in
some countries.  Assuming you have access to VC++, however, building the files is
fairly straightforward.  However, there is another problem.
</p><p>
The <span class="i">lame_enc.dll</span> encoder which is produced is not directly usable 
from Visual Basic. The reason for this is that all of the exported functions are
exported with the <span class="i">_cdecl</span> calling convention rather than
<span class="i">_stdcall</span> which is used by VB.  As described in the 
article <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=3489">CD Tracklisting using freedb.org</a>, one
way to get around this is to create a wrapper DLL in C which simply re-exports the
same functions with the correct calling convention.
</p><p>
This is the approach I've taken here.  The <span class="i">Lame Encoder Shim Source</span> download includes the source code for the wrapper. If you wish to compile it
yourself, then unzip the project into the <span class="i">lame-m.nn</span> directory that you have extracted LAME to, load the Example_vc6.dsw workspace from the Dll subdirectory into VC++ and then 
add the <span class="i">LameEncShim</span> project to the workspace and hopefully all will be well.  Please don't ask me for any advice about using VC++ or trying to convert this
to work in VC++7 as I am completely useless at both and only a combination of
increasingly desperate hacking and several glasses of Makers Mark allowed me 
to create the DLL at all.
</p><p>
Both LAME and the encoder shim are released under the LGPL.  Please check the 
<span class="code">gnuLicence.txt</span> provided with the DLLs for details of
your obligations if you use these files.
</p><h2>Getting Started With VB</h2><p>
With that nasty rubbish out of the way, we can get back to the somewhat easier world 
of VB and start working.  To use the encoder, you need to put the two Windows DLLs
in the <span class="i">Lame DLLs</span> download somewhere that you're VB application
will find them.  If you're debugging, then the easiest place to put them is in the 
Windows\System directory, however, for distribution they can be put into the same
directory as your application. Note that these are standard Win32 DLLs, <strong>not</strong> ActiveX DLLs and so they do not need to be registered.
</p><p>
The <span class="i">lame_enc.dll</span> in the download is version 3.96 of LAME.  
However, the LAME encoder is frequently updated, so you may wish to replace this
with the latest and greatest version.  This can be done independently of 
LameEncShim.DLL, which will work with any version of the Lame encoder DLL unless
the DLLs API changes (which is pretty unlikely).  To get the latest version you
will either need to build <span class="i">lame_enc.dll</span> yourself, or find one
from another application which includes it, such as <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=14896">CDEx</a>.
</p><h2>About the Demonstration Application</h2><p>
The demonstration application provides a very simple front end to the VB functions
which use these DLLs.  It displays the LAME encoder version information and allows
you to select a source WAV file and an MP3 file destination.  The encoder is 
configured using the preset encoding options which come with LAME, although the
code will allow you to make more detailed configuration settings if you want
to. Typically using the LAME presets will yield a better result as these presets
have been optimised for the best quality.
</p><p>
Clicking Encode starts the encoding process.  The application shows a progress
bar whilst encoding is underway, and allows the encoding to be cancelled.
</p><h2>Using the Encoder Functions</h2><p>
The LAME encoder DLL is based on the Blade Encoder API, and exposes a bare
minimum of functions to initialise a new stream, encode a block of data, close
the stream and get version information.  To make this API easier to use, there
are VB classes which wrap the commonly used functionality.  There are four classes
you need to encode Wave files to MP3:
</p><ol><li><span class="code">cLameEncoder</span><br />
This class provides the primary interface for working with encoding.  It allows
you to configure the encoding options, set file names and perform an encoding.</li><li><span class="code">cLameEncoderVersion</span><br />
Provides information about the version of the LAME encoder being used.  You should
display this information to any user of the application.
</li><li><span class="code">cWavReader</span><br />
Used internally to read the WAV
audio data. For more information about this class see the 
<a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=14451">Wave File Viewer Control</a> article.</li><li><span class="code">cMp3Writer</span><br />
Used internally to write the MP3 data out.  This class is basically a very simplistic
buffered file writer over a pointer to a block of memory.
</li></ol><p>
As demonstrated in the sample, using these wrappers allows you to perform an
encoding with only a few lines of code.  Firstly, you set up a <span class="code">WithEvents</span> instance of the <span class="code">cLameEncoder</span> class.
This allows you to receive the <span class="code">Progress</span> event which
allows your application to display progress and cancel any encoding operation:
</p><pre>
Private WithEvents m_cEncoder As cLameEncoder

Private Sub Form_Load()
   Set m_cEncoder = New cLameEncoder
End Sub

Private Sub m_cEncoder_Progress( _
    ByVal samplesDone As Long, _
    ByVal totalSamples As Long, _
    cancel As Boolean)

    ' .. Handle Progress and cancellation here 

End Sub
</pre><p>
Then you set the source WAV file, destination MP3 file and encoding options:
</p><pre>
Private Sub CreateMp3File( _
      ByVal sourceWavFile As String, _
      ByVal destinationMp3File As String, _
      ByVal eOption As ELamePresetEncodingOption _
   )
   m_cEncoder.WavFile = sourceFile
   m_cEncoder.Mp3File = destinationFile
   m_cEncoder.EncodingPreset = eOption

   m_cEncoder.Encode

End Sub
</pre><p>
That's pretty much it.  If you want your application to stay responsive whilst
encoding is underway, you should add a <span class="code">DoEvents</span> call
during the <span class="code">Progress</span> event.  Remember that any keyboard
or mouse input will be processed during the <span class="code">DoEvents</span> 
so typically you will want to disable areas of the user interface that should
not be modified whilst encoding is underway.  In particular, you should 
<strong>not</strong> call <span class="code">Encode</span> again whilst encoding
is underway.
</p><h2>More Details</h2><p>
This section may be of assistance to anyone who wants to customise the workings of the
class to work with different input or output sources, or to understand how to
configure the MP3 encoder through the more sophisticated customised configuration
options.
</p><p>
There are only four calls to the Blade Encoder API you need to perform an encoding:
</p><ol><li><span class="code">beInitStream</span><br />
Creates a new encoding stream using the passed in parameters and returns the
number of samples the encoding stream expects for each encoding call, the size
of the buffer needed for the output of each encoding call and a handle to
the stream which is used in subsequent calls.
</li><li><span class="code">beEncodeChunk</span><br />
Encodes a chunk of sample data and puts the result into a buffer, returning
the actual size of the encoded data.
</li><li><span class="code">beDeinitStream</span><br />
Places any end-of-file data into a buffer.
</li><li><span class="code">beCloseStream</span><br />
Closes any resources associated with the encoding stream once encoding has been completed.</li></ol><p>
Each function uses the characteristic C error handling style where the return
value of the function is a success or error code, defined by the <span class="code">BE_ERR</span> constants:
</p><pre>
Public Enum ELameErrorCode
   BE_ERR_SUCCESSFUL = &amp;H0
   BE_ERR_INVALID_FORMAT = &amp;H1
   BE_ERR_INVALID_FORMAT_PARAMETERS = &amp;H2
   BE_ERR_NO_MORE_HANDLES = &amp;H3
   BE_ERR_INVALID_HANDLE = &amp;H4
   BE_ERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL = &amp;H5
End Enum
</pre><p>
In the next four sections I'll look at these calls in more detail.
</p><h3>1. beInitStream</h3><p>
The <span class="code">beInitStream</span> declare is as follows:
</p><pre>
Private Declare Function beInitStream Lib "lameencshim.dll" ( _
   beConfig As BE_CONFIG, _
   pdwSamples As Long, _
   pdwBufferSize As Long, _
   phbeStream As Long) As Long
</pre><ul><li><span class="code">beConfig</span> - a <span class="code">BE_CONFIG</span> type
containing the configuration information for the MP3 encoding.</li><li><span class="code">pdwSamples</span> - a variable which receives the number
of samples the encoder will process in each block.</li><li><span class="code">pdwBufferSize</span> - the size of the buffer to allocate
to receive output from the encoder.</li><li><span class="code">phbeStream</span> - the handle to the newly opened stream, if
successful.</li></ul><p>
The main work in setting up a stream is setting up the configuration information.
The <span class="code">BE_CONFIG</span> structure can have alternative forms 
depending upon what use it is being put to, however, in the case of the LAME 
engine you only need to consider the LHV1 form:
</p><pre>
Private Type BE_CONFIG_FORMAT_LHV1
   dwStructVersion As Long
   dwStructSize As Long
   dwSampleRate As ELameSampleRate
   dwReSampleRate As Long
   nMode As ELameOutputModeOption
   dwBitRate As ELameBitRate
   dwMaxBitrate As Long
   nPreset As ELamePresetEncodingOption
   dwMpegVersion As ELameMP3Version
   dwPsyModel As Long
   dwEmphasis As Long
   bPrivate As Long
   bCRC As Long
   bCopyright As Long
   bOriginal As Long
   bWriteVBRHeader As Long
   bEnableVBR As Long
   nVBRQuality As ELameVBRQualityOption
   dwVbrAbr_bps As Long
   nVBRMethod As ELameVBRMethodOption
   bNoBitRes As Long
   bStrictIso As Long
   nQuality As Integer
   bPadding(0 To 236) As Byte   
End Type

Private Type BE_CONFIG_FORMAT
   lvh1 As BE_CONFIG_FORMAT_LHV1
End Type

Private Type BE_CONFIG  '331
   dwConfig As Long ' EBeConfigFormat, 4
   format As BE_CONFIG_FORMAT ' 327
End Type
</pre><p>
The fields in the LVH1 structure are as follows:
</p><ul><li><span class="code">dwStructVersion</span> - version of the structure, should be
set to 1.</li><li><span class="code">dwStructSize</span> - size of the overall BE_CONFIG structure,
in this case 331 bytes.</li><li><span class="code">dwSampleRate</span> - sample rate in Hz for the MP3 file.  This
can be set to one of:
<ul><li>32000, 44100 or 48000 for MPEG-I</li><li>16000, 22050 or 24000 for MPEG-I</li><li>8000, 11025 or 12000 for MPEG-II.5</li></ul></li><li><span class="code">dwReSampleRate</span> - specifes the resampling rate to
use against the input stream.  Setting this to 0 causes the encoder to decide the rate.
</li><li><span class="code">nMode</span> - the stereo mode of the Mp3 file.  This can be one of:
<ul><li><span class="code">BE_MP3_MODE_STEREO</span></li><li><span class="code">BE_MP3_MODE_JSTEREO</span></li><li><span class="code">BE_MP3_MODE_DUALCHANNEL</span></li><li><span class="code">BE_MP3_MODE_MONO</span></li></ul></li><li><span class="code">dwBitRate</span> - specifies the bit rate to use.  For Constant Bit-Rate (CBR) encoding, this is the actual bit rate, whereas for Variable Bit-Rate
(VBR) encoding it specifies the minimum.  Allowable values are:
<ul><li>8 - MPEG-II only</li><li>16 - MPEG-II only</li><li>24 - MPEG-II only</li><li>32</li><li>40</li><li>48</li><li>56</li><li>64</li><li>80</li><li>96</li><li>112</li><li>128</li><li>144 - MPEG-II only</li><li>160</li><li>192 - MPEG-I only.</li><li>224 - MPEG-I only.</li><li>256  - MPEG-I only.</li><li>320 - MPEG-I only.</li></ul></li><li><span class="code">dwMaxBitrate</span> - When VBR mode is enabled, this specifies the maximum allowed bitrate.  The same values as <span class="code">dwBitRate</span>
are used.For CBR mode this setting is ignored.</li><li><span class="code">nPreset</span> - one of the preset encoding options to
use.  Note that presets can overwrite the other settings, since the call to
apply the preset's setting is made just before the encoder is initialised. 
<ul><li><span class="code">LQP_NOPRESET</span> - don't use any presets</li><li><span class="code">LQP_NORMAL_QUALITY</span> - quality is set to 5.</li><li><span class="code">LQP_LOW_QUALITY</span> - quality is set to 9.</li><li><span class="code">LQP_HIGH_QUALITY</span> - quality is set to 2.</li><li><span class="code">LQP_VOICE_QUALITY</span> - use for voice encoding.</li><li><span class="code">LQP_R3MIX</span>  - r3mix preset option</li><li><span class="code">LQP_VERYHIGH_QUALITY</span> - quality is set to 0</li><li><span class="code">LQP_STANDARD</span> - lame command line alt-preset standard</li><li><span class="code">LQP_FAST_STANDARD</span> - lame command line alt-preset fast standard</li><li><span class="code">LQP_EXTREME</span> - lame command line alt-preset extreme</li><li><span class="code">LQP_FAST_EXTREME</span> - lame command line alt-preset fast extreme.</li><li><span class="code">LQP_INSANE</span> - lame command line alt-preset insane.</li><li><span class="code">LQP_ABR</span> - lame command line alt-preset abr.</li><li><span class="code">LQP_CBR</span> - lame command line alt-preset cbr.</li></ul>
Note that some
presets configure all of the settings, whereas others only affect parts of the
configuration. For example, <span class="code">LQP_HIGH_QUALITY</span> does not affect the bit-rate or sampling frequency, whereas <span class="code">LQP_STANDARD</span>
will set VBR mode and the bit rate to 200-240kbps.
</li><li><span class="code">dwMpegVersion</span> - the MPEG version  to use, one of
<ul><li><span class="code">MPEG1</span> = 1</li><li><span class="code">MPEG2</span> = 0</li></ul></li><li><span class="code">dwPsyModel</span> - this parameter does not appear to be used
currently. Assumption is that it would be for adjusting a parameter to the 
Psycho-Acoustic model.</li><li><span class="code">dwEmphasis</span> - - this parameter does not appear to be used
currently.  Assumption is to configure the emphasis amount.</li><li><span class="code">bPrivate</span> - If this is set to TRUE (1) the Private 
bit in the MP3 stream will be set.</li><li><span class="code">bCRC</span>  - Set this to TRUE in order to enable CRC-checksum in the bitstream.</li><li><span class="code">bCopyright</span> - If this is set to TRUE the Copyright bit in the MP3 stream will be set.</li><li><span class="code">bOriginal</span> - If this is set to TRUE the Original bit in the MP3 stream will be set.</li><li><span class="code">bWriteVBRHeader</span> - Specifes if the XING VBR header should be written or not. When this option is enabled, you have to call the beWriteVBRHeader function when encoding has been completed. Keep in mind that the VBR info tag can also be written for CBR encoded files, the TAG info can be useful for additional info like encoder delay and the like.</li><li><span class="code">bEnableVBR</span> - Whether to enable VBR encoding.</li><li><span class="code">nVBRQuality</span> - VBR quality option, one of
<ul><li><span class="code">VBR_QUALITY_0_HIGHEST</span> = 0</li><li><span class="code">VBR_QUALITY_1_HIGH</span>  = 1</li><li><span class="code">VBR_QUALITY_2_HIGH</span>  = 2</li><li><span class="code">VBR_QUALITY_3_MID</span>  = 3</li><li><span class="code">VBR_QUALITY_4_MID</span>  = 4</li><li><span class="code">VBR_QUALITY_5_MID</span>  = 5</li><li><span class="code">VBR_QUALITY_6_MID</span>  = 6</li><li><span class="code">VBR_QUALITY_7_LOW</span>  = 7</li><li><span class="code">VBR_QUALITY_8_LOW</span>  = 8</li><li><span class="code">VBR_QUALITY_9_LOWEST</span>  = 9</li></ul></li><li><span class="code">dwVbrAbr_bps</span> - specifies an Average Bit Rate (ABR) 
encoding. If this is specified, the lame encoder ignores the 
<span class="code">nVBRQuality</span> settings.   To use this, <span class="code">bEnableVBR</span> must be set to TRUE and 
the <span class="code">nVbrMethod</span> parameter should be set to <span class="code">VBR_METHOD_ABR</span>). 
The allowed range for the average bit rate is an integer value between:
<ul><li>MPEG-I: 32000 .. 320000 bps</li><li>MPEG-II: 8000 .. 160000 bps</li></ul></li><li><span class="code">nVBRMethod</span> - the VBR method to use.  One of

encoding.</li><li><span class="code">nQuality</span> - Set the quality, from 0 (highest) to 9 (lowest).
For backward compatibility reasons, the quality value must have the high-byte set to
<span class="code">Not</span> the low-byte.  So the values will be: &amp;HFF00 = 0, &amp;HFE01 = 1 ... &amp;HF609 = 9.</li><li><span class="code">bPadding</span> - Not used, provided for future expansion.</li></ul><h3>2. beEncodeChunk</h3><p>
This function is called repeatedly on each chunk of waveform data to create
the MP3 output file.  The declare is as follows:
</p><pre>
Private Declare Function beEncodeChunk Lib "lameencshim.dll" ( _
   ByVal hbeStream As Long, _
   ByVal nSamples As Long, _
   pSamples As Any, _
   pOutput As Any, _

   ) As Long
</pre><ul><li><span class="code">hbeStream</span> - Handle to the encoding stream previously
returned by <span class="code">beInitStream</span>.</li><li><span class="code">nSamples</span> - The number of samples to convert.  This
must be equal or less than the <span class="code">dwSamples</span> number
returned by <span class="code">beInitStream</span>.</li><li><span class="code">pSamples</span> - pointer to a buffer containing the samples.

data to.  Data in this buffer is assumed to be an array of 8-bit values.</li><li><span class="code">pdwOutput</span> - variable which will receive the actual

In the download code, the input buffer is a memory-mapped file view onto a source
Wave file using the multimedia API functions, and the output buffer a block of
memory allocated using the <span class="code">LocalAlloc</span> API.  However, since the
encoding works on memory buffers, there is no need to have files as a source.  For
example, the input buffer could be a pointer to a stream of data read from a 
CD, or from the analogue input from the PC.
</p><h3>3. beDeinitStream</h3><p>
This function writes any terminating data out to the buffer, so it works very similarly
to the <span class="code">beEncodeChunk</span> function, the only difference being
that it does not require any input data and so the <span class="code">nSamples</span>
and <span class="code">pSamples</span> parameters are not required.  The declare is:
</p><pre>
Private Declare Function beDeinitStream Lib "lameencshim.dll" ( _
   ByVal hbeStream As Long, _
   pOutput As Any, _
   pdwOutput As Long) As Long
</pre><h3>4. beCloseStream</h3><p>
This function performs clean up of any resources allocated for the MP3 file, 
and should be called as soon as the encoding has been completed.
</p><pre>
Private Declare Function beCloseStream Lib "lameencshim.dll" ( _
   ByVal hbeStream As Long) As Long
</pre><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
This article demonstrates how to use the LAME encoder to create MP3 files from
WAV files using VB.  To do this, a very simple wrapper over the LAME encoder DLL
is needed which provides direct wrappers around each of the LAME functions to 
modify the calling convention so it can be used from VB.  The code should be easy
to work with to create MP3s from WAV data sources other than files as well.
