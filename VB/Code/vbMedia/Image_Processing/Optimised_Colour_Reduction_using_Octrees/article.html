optimised colour palettes of arbitrary depth (although typically used for 256 colours)
from any image and compares the results with other colour reduction methods.</p><h2>The Octree Algorithm</h2><p>In an Octree, the idea is to build up a memory tree which divides into 8 levels at each
point.  An example of the tree with the first level shown and an expansion of one object
in the second level is shown below.</p><img src="octree.png" width="340" height="110" alt="Octree Algorithm Data Structure" /><p>Typically the tree depth is set at 8 levels, which enables sufficient space to give 
all possible RGB values a separate object. Obviously if you did create all these objects 
the performance and memory requirements would be terrible, since you would 
need 8 objects in the first line, then 64 objects for the next line, then 512 for the next 
and so on (i.e. well over 16 million).  Therefore elements in the
tree are only constructed on demand.  As you will see, the ultimate number of objects created 
only ever exceeds the number of colours you're reducing to by a small amount so the 
actual implementation is very efficient.</p><p>Each object in the tree is set up so as well as storing the links to the next objects
in the tree, it can also store a summation of red, green and blue values as well as the
number of pixels the sum has been done over.</p><p>The algorithm is them implemented as follows:</p><ul><li>Firstly, a routine to determine in which object
at each level a colour should be placed is calculated.  
In the first level, there are eight objects to choose
from.  Eight objects is the equivalent of three independent on-off states (since 2^3 = 8)
so we can take the high bit of each of the R,G,B values, shifting R by two bits and
G by 1bit.  For the next level, the same process is used but the second highest bit
is taken, and so on until the there are no bits left (and you've reached the bottom of
the tree.</li><li>Next, code for creating the objects in the octree, linking them together and
keeping count of how many there are is implemented.</li><li>Finally, a procedure to reduce the tree size when too many colours are in the tree
is created.  This procedure starts at the very bottom of the tree.  Whilst there
are still too many objects in the tree, take all of the child objects of the lowest
level item, and add them to the object above.  Then delete all the child objects
and mark the level above as the bottom of the tree.</li></ul><h2>Results</h2><p>The results of the algorithm are usually fairly impressive, although
for images with a large number of colours and gentle shading you will still see some
artifacts of the colouring algorithm (remember that you require 16 million colours
before it becomes impossible to distinguish between two adjacent colours; 256 is 
considerably less than that.)  However, the results are considerably better than
using the system default palette to achieve the effect, and aren't noticeably
dithered as they are when using the <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=3172">Floyd-Stucci
colour reduction</a> method.</p><p>A comparison of the results on Mr Bing's Cocktail Lounge is shown below.  Note that
all of these images are sample areas from a larger picture which originally contained
78,800 unique colours.</p><h3>Using System Defaults</h3><img src="mrBingSystem.png" width="197" height="162" alt="System Default Colour Reduction" /><p>As you see, the system default colour reduction method is pretty hopeless. You'll probably 
have seen this sort of thing happening if you've ever used a VB application splash screen where
the author forgot that you might have been working a lower-colour depth system.</p><h3>Using Floyd-Stucci Method and a Web-Safe Palette</h3><img src="mrBingFloyd.png" width="197" height="162" alt="Floyd-Stucci Dithered Colour Reduction" /><p>I personally quite like the dithered image effect when the image detail is large enough,
as the dither is often quite pleasing.  However, the dither is quite noticeable in the shadow areas.</p><h3>Using Octrees</h3><img src="mrBingOptimal.png" width="197" height="162" alt="With Octree created optimal palette" /><p>The image here is the smoothest, but there are still artifacts in the detailed shadow areas owing
to the lack of colour depth.  The only real way around this is to use more highly stylised images 
(for example, by reducing the contrast) as a basis for bitmaps which need to be shown in multiple colour depths.</p><h2>Implementing It in VB</h2><p>Basically implementing this algorithm is something of a bitch, as is often
the case with any types of Linked-List or Tree algorithm structure in VB.  You
can see a sample implementation put together by Brian Schimpf in the 
<a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=">Colour Depth Control</a> sample.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p></td><td class="rightbar" valign="top" bgcolor="#C2BEB1">
