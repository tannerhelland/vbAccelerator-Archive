'
' Description:
' A class which can add scroll bars to VB Forms, Picture Boxes and
' UserControls.
' Features:
'  * True API scroll bars, which don't flash or draw badly like
'    the VB ones
'  * Scroll bar values are long integers, i.e. &gt;2 billion values
'  * Set Flat or Encarta scroll bar modes if your COMCTL32.DLL version
'    supports it (&gt;4.72)
'
' Updates:
' 2003-07-02
'  * Added Mouse Wheel Support.  Thanks to Chris Eastwood for
'    the suggestion and starter code.
'    Visit his site at http://vbcodelibrary.co.uk/
'  * Scroll bar now goes to bottom when SB_BOTTOM fired
'    (e.g. right click on scroll bar with mouse)
'  * New ScrollClick events to enable focus
'  * Removed a large quantity of redundant declares which
'    had found their way into this class somehow...
