For example, 
when Office is opening a document the cursor switches to an animation of a yellow handbag 
throwing up a small piece of paper (I think that's what it is, anyway).</p><p>It would be nice to do it this in VB too, yes? Well, as ever with graphics support in VB, 
you can't do it with the standard methods. The bizarre <i>MouseIcon</i> property lets you 
set a custom cursor, but this is yet another low quality workaround for the limitations of the 
Picture object and so it doesn't work with colour or animated cursors.</p><p>But with the aid of a few hardcore hacks you can make VB show cool animated cursors. 
A rather dismal collection of animated cursors is included with the sample, you can
get more from the <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=5248">Animated Cursor</a> section of the
Graphics Library.</p><h2>This is Easy, Yes?</h2><p>The easy bit is to get VB to load and draw an animated cursor. This is achieved using 
the multi-talented Win32 <i>LoadImage</i> and <i>DrawIconEx</i> functions. These functions 
are poorly supported in the Win32 API text supplied with VB5, as they are given with 
misleading declares and also all the constants you need to use them are missing. 
The proper declares and constants are in the <i>cAniCursor</i> class, which wraps up these 
methods to provide an easy to use class for loading animated or standard cursors from files 
or resources, managing cursor handles and also drawing any frame of a cursor.</p><h2>When I Said 3 Lines of Code, I Underestimated</h2><p>Its a bit more tricky to persuade VB to show your cursor like a standard mouse pointer. 
VB is very secretive about how it implements cursors and so you must guess how it does it. 
My code shows two different ways of setting the cursor for a control or form and also a rather 
brute force method of setting the cursor so it emulates VB's Screen.MousePointer.</p><p>Setting the cursor for a form or control can be achieved in two ways:</p><ol><li>Modifying the Win32 Class Cursor for the window</li><li>Subclassing the <i>WM_SETCURSOR</i> message and using the <i>SetCursor</i> call to apply 
your own cursor.</li></ol><p>The first method is the simplest, but intercepting <i>WM_SETCURSOR</i> gives you more flexibility. 
A limitation which applies to both methods is that the method only works directly for objects 
which have a <i>hWnd</i> property. Labels, Images, Shapes and Lightweight controls are drawn 
directly onto their parent window handle. If you need control to detect whether the mouse is 
actually over a lightweight control you must use the subclassing method, because the class 
cursor method applies to the entire window, whereas the <i>WM_SETCURSOR</i> message is fired 
whenever the mouse is moved and so you get the opportunity to change what you set depending on 
where the pointer is.</p><p>Setting the cursor using the class cursor method is supported directly in the <i>cAniCursor</i> class. 
Subclassing a form or control to set the cursor is supported by the <i>cCustomCursor</i> class.</p><p>To emulate VB's Screen.MousePointer method is more difficult. In effect what you want to 
do is to apply either of the two methods which apply to a single form or control to every form 
and control in your VB project. That means quite a bit of work! It would be possible to enumerate 
all the windows and their children in your project and then set the class cursor 
for each to the same thing, or to apply a subclass to every one. However, a simpler 
way of achieving this effect is to use a Windows Hook. There are various types of Windows Hooks, 
the one used here is the <i>WH_CALLWNDPROCRET</i> hook. This hook is called for every single window 
in your process whenever windows calls that Window's <i>WndProc</i> function (i.e. 
the function you normally trap when you subclass a window). So using this hook we can 
emulate applying a subclass on every window in your entire project at once!</p><p>The only downside of using this hook is that it can slow down performance of your application 
when it is in place. However, since you normally want to show a <i>Screen.MousePointer</i> when your 
application is busy doing something, this usually isn't an issue. Your app blocks <i>WndProc</i>
 calls whilst it is actively doing work so there is no performance impact.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p></td><td class="rightbar" valign="top" bgcolor="#C2BEB1">
