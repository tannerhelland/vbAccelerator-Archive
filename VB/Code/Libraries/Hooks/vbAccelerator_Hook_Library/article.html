When a subclass isn't tough enough for the job, its time to move to an even lower-level 
and more disruptive technique. Win32 Hooks are a method by which you can tap into the 
Windows message stream for every single message directed to every window in your application. 
You can modify or even discard messages before they even reach the target window. This technique gives 
you a lot of control! 
</p><p>
Windows Hooks are defined in the Win32 SDK as follows: 
</p><ul><li>
"A Windows hook is a point in the system message-handling mechanism where an 
application can install a subroutine to monitor the message traffic in the system 
and process certain types of messages before they reach the target window procedure." 
</li><li>
"Hooks tend to slow down the system because they increase the amount of processing 
the system must perform for each message. You should install a hook only when necessary, 
and remove it as soon as possible." 
</li></ul><h2>About Hooks</h2><p>
This section provides a detailed look into what hooks consist of, why you use them
and the various types available:
</p><ol><li>Hooks Compared to Sub-Classing</li><li>An Example</li><li>Hook Scope: System Wide or Local Thread Hooks</li><li>Types Of Windows Hooks</li><li>Hook Chains</li></ol><h3>1. Hooks Compared to Sub-Classing</h3><p>
Essentially a Windows Hook is like a subclass except it applies at the 
next point up in the message chain. In Win32, messages are queued and sent to 
the appropriate window via the <span class="code">WindowProc</span> function. A 
subclass can intercept messages by replacing the existing <span class="code">WindowProc</span> 
function with a new one. 
</p><p>
With a Hook, you get to see all messages <span class="i">before</span> Windows has decided which 
<span class="code">WindowProc</span> procedure to direct the message to. You can modify 
or discard most messages at this point too. So using the Hook technique you not only get to 
act on messages at the highest point; you can also get at messages regardless of 
which window the message is intended for. This is very useful if you want to process
Keyboard or Mouse messages on a global basis in your application, because these 
messages are normally directed to the window with the focus.  If you tried to do the 
same thing using Subclassing then you would have to subclass every single window handle in 
your application to follow the mouse events. Using a Hook, the process is simple!
</p><h3>2. An Example</h3><img src="hooksamp.gif" width="251" height="180" alt="MDI Form with a 'Toolbar' button" /><p class="caption">MDI Form with a 'Toolbar' button</p><p>
If you create a VB application like the one shown above, you'll find that it doesn't behave
like you would expect a normal Windows application to.  Since the <strong>N</strong> mnemonic
is visible on screen, it should be accessible at any time by pressing <span class="i">Alt+N</span>.
However, this is isn't the case in VB - in fact <span class="i">Alt+N</span> only does anything
when the MDI form has the focus, which is clearly a bug.
</p><p>
This is actually a fundamental problem in VB for MDI forms - there is no way 
for an accelerator on another form to be active when there is a child 
form active. We could solve this problem by duplicating the New button onto the 
child form, but in order for it to respond to accelerator keys it must be visible and 
part of the tab order - not what you want. 
</p><p>
Solving the problem with a Windows Hook on the other hand is quite simple. We install 
a hook of type <span class="code">WH_KEYBOARD</span>. Then the app receives all 
keyboard events for the entire application. When the keyboard events indicate that 
<span class="i">Alt+N</span> has been pressed, the code just needs to check whether the 
MDIForm is the same as the window returned by <span class="code">GetActiveWindow</span>; 
if it is it then the code fires the <span class="code">cmdNew_Click</span> event and 
eats the keyboard message. 
</p><h3>3. Hook Scope: System Wide or Local Thread Hooks</h3><p>
One of the features of the Win32 Hook functions is that they allow you to specify 
whether the scope of your hook is local to the current thread or whether it applies 
to all windows in the entire system. System Wide hooks are always a topic of interest 
because they let you read data intended for or otherwise modify windows owned by other 
applications; for example the <a href="http://www.stardock.com/">Window Blinds</a> application 
uses this method to apply a skin when drawing all windows on your system (well, it tries to, anyway!)
</p><p>
Before you get excited, though, VB on its own cannot be used to create a 
system-wide hook. This is because the hook procedure <strong>must</strong> reside within 
a Windows DLL, and VB cannot create these beasts (because you cannot specify to 
export the HookProc function). Also I should point out that system-wide hooks aren't much 
fun to write: you can't debug them very easily, and if anything goes wrong it 
takes your whole system down!  If you have some C/C++ knowledge, however, there are various
samples of creating system-wide hooks at MSDN and CodeGuru.
</p><h3>4. Types Of Windows Hooks</h3><p>
There are 14 different types of Windows Hooks defined in Win32, however, some of these 
are not implemented and some cannot be used in Visual Basic or are of very limited value 
when not used System Wide. 
</p><p>
That leaves the following: 
</p><ul><li><span class="code"><strong>WH_KEYBOARD</strong></span><p>
Intercepts all keyboard messages and allows you to modify or discard any message (except 
<span class="i">Ctrl+Alt+Del</span>). For example, the 
<a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=1272">vbAccelerator Toolbar, Rebar and CoolMenu</a> 
uses this hook to check for accelerators. 
</p></li><li><span class="code"><strong>WH_MOUSE</strong></span><p>
Intercepts all mouse messages and allows you to modify or discard any message. 
</p></li><li><span class="code"><strong>WH_CALLWNDPROC</strong></span><p>
Before Windows is about to call any window procedure within the scope of the Hook, it fires this 
hook with the details of the parameters it will use to call the window procedure. 
It allows you to modify any of the parameters of the message sent and hence provides considerable
opportunity to radically change (or break) the way Windows works.
</p></li><li><span class="code"><strong>WH_CALLWNDPROCRET</strong></span><p>
Similar to <span class="code">WH_CALLWNDPROC</span> except it is called whenever a 
window procedure within the scope of the Hook returns. It allows you to modify the return value 
or parameters for the message. For example, the <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=12">Animated Cursors 
in VB</a> sample uses this to capture the <span class="code">WM_SETCURSOR</span> message 
for every window to emulate the <span class="code">Screen.MousePointer</span> property. 
</p></li><li><span class="code"><strong>WH_MSGFILTER</strong></span><p>
This Hook allows you to process or modify all messages meant for all the dialog boxes, 
message boxes, scroll bars or menus in an application. For example, the 
<a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=1272">vbAccelerator Toolbar, Rebar and CoolMenu</a> control uses 
this hook to find out what messages are being sent when menus are dropped down, so 
it can close Popup Menus depending on where the mouse is.
</p></li><li><span class="code"><strong>WH_GETMESSAGE</strong></span><p>
This Hook is called whenever a window within the Hook scope calls the 
<span class="code">GetMessage</span> or <span class="code">PeekMessage</span> functions. 
</p></li><li><span class="code"><strong>WH_CBT</strong></span><p>
Computer-based training hook. Fired when windows are created, destroyed, moved 
and activated etc. This Hook is intended for use to capture a sequence of messages 
which can be replayed for CBT apps, however, better uses for it include detecting 
the window handle of API windows like Menus, Common Dialogs and Message Boxes
and the one MFC puts it to - automatically detect creation of all windows within an 
application and applying a subclass procedure to each one. 
</p></li><li><strong><span class="code">WH_JOURNALRECORD</span> and <span class="code">WH_JOURNALPLAYBACK</span></strong><p>
These hooks enables you to monitor and record input events for later playback.
The interesting thing about these hooks is that even though they only work when 
installed on a system-wide scope, they can send and receive input messages on
a system-wide basis from within a local process.
</p></li></ul><h3>5. Hook Chains</h3><p>
When you install a Hook, Win32 actually adds it to what is termed the "Hook Chain". 
This allows you to install multiple Hooks of the same type in an application. 
When the first Hook is added, Windows places it at the start of the chain and begins 
passing messages to the Hook and receiving them from it. If another hook of the 
same type is added on the same thread, windows then directs output from the first 
hook to the second one before receiving the output for its own use. 
</p><p>
This means that you must be careful when using a Hook to modify or remove messages. 
If there are two Hooks on the same thread, and one removes messages, behaviour may 
differ depending on the order the Hooks are installed. In VB there is very little control over 
the order that controls are created so you should attempt to ensure the same hook procedure
is used for all objects that install a hook.
</p><h2>The vbAccelerator Windows Hooks Library</h2><p>
The vbAccelerator Windows Hooks Library is designed to simplify the process of
working with hooks in your application.  It provides a series of functions for
installing and removing hooks and ensures multiple clients use the same
hook function rather than installing multiple chained hooks.  It is designed
to be used either as a DLL or compiled directly into your application. An example 
of compiling the library directly into code is provided in the 
<a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=12335">vbAccelerator Accelerator control</a>, so this 
section will cover using the DLL version.
</p><p>
The Hooks Library consists of two parts: 
</p><ol><li><span class="code"><strong>IWindowsHook</strong></span><p>
You must implement this interface to use the Hook library. Once your object 
implements this interface, then whenever the Hook(s) you connect to fire, the 
<span class="code">IWindowsHook_HookProc</span> method will be called with the Hook 
information. 
</p></li><li><span class="code"><strong>GHook</strong></span><p>
This interface allows you to attach and detach a Hook, as well as providing 
some helper functions for translating the <span class="code">lParam</span> member of the hook 
function, which contains the details about the message being intercepted by the Hook. 
</p></li></ol><h2>Quick Start</h2><p>
This sample will give you a quick introduction to the Hooks library. 
Start a new project, and add a reference to the 
<span class="i">vbAccelerator Window Hooks Library</span> by choosing 
Project-&gt;References and selecting the "vbAccelerator Windows Hook Helper DLL". 
If it isn't there, click Browse and search for <span class="i">vbalHook.DLL</span> (VB5) or
<span class="i">vbalHook6.DLL</span> (VB6) on your disk. Once you have a reference, add 
various controls to your form including a TextBox control. Then add the following code: 
</p><pre>
Implements IWindowsHook

Private Sub Form_Load()
   InstallHook Me, WH_KEYBOARD
End Sub

Private Sub Form_QueryUnload( _
      Cancel As Integer, UnloadMode As Integer)
   RemoveHook Me, WH_KEYBOARD
End Sub

Private Function IWindowsHook_HookProc( _
      ByVal eType As EHTHookTypeConstants, _
      ByVal nCode As Long, _
      ByVal wParam As Long, _
      ByVal lParam As Long, _
      bConsume As Boolean _
   ) As Long

   If KeyBoardlParam(lParam).KeyDown Then
      If Me.ActiveControl is Text1 Then
         txtTest.SelText = " "
         bConsume = True
      End If
   End If
End Function
</pre><p>
Now run the project. Whenever the TextBox control Text1 is in focus, pressing 
the tab key will cause the tab characters to be entered into the text box 
rather than moving to the next control in the tab index. This works because all 
key presses in the project are sent through the <span class="code">IWindowsHook_HookProc</span>
 function before being sent to any control or form. So you can consume any key press 
you want and stop it ever reaching the control! Now that's control... 
</p><h2>The Sample Code</h2><p>
There are two samples provided with the download: 
</p><ol><li><strong>HookKeyEvents</strong><p>This sample shows how to hook key events using a <span class="code">WH_KEYBOARD</span> hook, 
similar to the Quick Start sample above. It demonstrates tab key handling in a 
TextBox, ListBox and ComboBox and also how to make a form unload in response to the 
Escape key regardless of whether there is a CommandButton or Control with the 
<span class="code">Cancel</span> property set. 
</p></li><li><strong>MouseHook</strong><p>This sample demonstrates hooking mouse events. It uses a <span class="code">WH_MOUSE</span>
 hook to intercept all mouse events before they reach the form or control. This allows the 
sample to provide: 
</p><ul><li>A status bar indication of which control the mouse is over.</li><li>A "select controls" mode which works similarly to the selection of controls in the VB IDE.</li></ul><p>
Both pieces of code are completely independent of which specific controls are 
on the form - you can add as many new controls as you like to the form in any 
relationship to each other and the code will continue to work. 
</p><p>
With a little more design work it should be possible to create a form designer which 
works exactly the same as the VB IDE from this sample!
