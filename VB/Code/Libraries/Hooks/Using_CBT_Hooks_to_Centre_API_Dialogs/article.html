Windows sometimes places Common Dialogs and Message Boxes at the "wrong" position
on the screen.  Whilst there are some ways of working around this for Common
Dialogs, a more general solution which applies to any Windows dialog is to use
a <span class="code">CBT</span> (Computer-Based Training) Windows Hook.  These
Hooks provide notification when any Window in your process is created, activated,
focused, moved or destroyed.
</p><h2>Using a <span class="code">WH_CBT</span> Hook</h2><p><span class="code">WH_CBT</span> hooks are intended primarily for Computer-Based Training
applications, but provide a significant amount of power in intercepting and modifying the
way Windows works.  Once you install a <span class="code">WH_CBT</span> hook, you will
start receiving these hook notifications for every window within the process you've
installed the hook in:
</p><ul><li><span class="code">HCBT_CREATEWND</span> = 3
<p>A window is about to be created.  The system calls the hook procedure before sending 
the <span class="code">WM_CREATE</span> or <span class="code">WM_NCCREATE</span> message to 
the window.  Whilst the window has been created, at this point its size may not have
been set, nor the parent window.  If the hook procedure returns a nonzero value, 
the system destroys the window.
</p><ul><li>
The <span class="code">wParam</span> member of the hook notification contains the handle
of the new window.
</li><li>
The <span class="code">lParam</span> member contains a pointer to a <span class="code">CBT_CREATEWND</span> 
structure allowing you to modify the initial size and position of the window.
</li></ul></li><li><span class="code">HCBT_DESTROYWND</span> = 4
<p>
A window is about to be destroyed.  Return 1 to prevent this from occurring.
</p><ul><li>The <span class="code">wParam</span> member of the hook notification contains the handle
of the window about to be destroyed.</li><li>The <span class="code">lParam</span> value is undefined and must be ignored.</li></ul></li><li><span class="code">HCBT_MOVESIZE</span> = 0
<p>
A window is about to be moved or sized.  Return 1 to prevent the window position from being changed.
</p><ul><li>
The <span class="code">wParam</span> member of the hook notification contains the handle
of the window being moved or sized.
</li><li>
The <span class="code">lParam</span> member contains a pointer to a 
<span class="code">RECT</span> containing the coordinates of the window. This
can be modified to set the window's ultimate position and size.
</li></ul></li><li><span class="code">HCBT_MINMAX</span> = 1
<p>
A window is about to be minimized or maximized.  
Return 1 to prevent the window position from being changed.
</p><ul><li>
The <span class="code">wParam</span> member of the hook notification contains the handle
of the window being minimized or maximized.
</li><li>
The low-word of the <span class="code">lParam</span> member contains the show-window
(<span class="code">SW_*</span> constant) specifying the operation to be performed.
</li></ul></li><li><span class="code">HCBT_ACTIVATE</span> = 5
<p>
The system is about to activate a window.  Return 1 to prevent the window from being activated.
</p><ul><li>
The <span class="code">wParam</span> member of the hook notification contains the handle
of the window being activate.
</li><li>
The <span class="code">lParam</span> member contains a pointer to a
<span class="code">CBTACTIVATESTRUCT</span> structure containing details about the activation
operation.
</li></ul></li><li><span class="code">HCBT_SETFOCUS</span> = 9
<p>
A window is about to receive the keyboard focus.  Return 1 to prevent the window from recieving focus.
</p><ul><li>
The <span class="code">wParam</span> member of the hook notification contains the handle
of the window about to receive focus.
</li><li>
The <span class="code">lParam</span> member contains the handle of the window about to lose
focus.
</li></ul></li><li><span class="code">HCBT_SYSCOMMAND</span> = 8
<p>
A system command is about to be carried out.   Return 1 to prevent the System Command from 
begin performed. 
</p><ul><li>
The <span class="code">wParam</span> member of the hook notification contains the system command code 
(<span class="code">SC_*</span>) about to be performed.
</li><li>
The <span class="code">lParam</span> member contains <span class="code">lParam</span> which
will be send along with this <span class="code">WM_SYSCOMMAND</span> message.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
As you can see, you can use the hook to detect any window that is created or destroyed
as well as to substantively alter how the user interface works.  In the case of centring
dialogs, however, we only need to detect when the dialog is created.
</p><p>
Note there are also three other <span class="code">HCBT_</span> codes associated with CBT
applications which aren't covered here; these are only used in conjunction with
a <span class="code">WH_JOURNALPLAYBACK</span> hook.
</p><h2>Centring Common Dialogs and Message Boxes</h2><p>
To centre a Common Dialog or Message Box, you need to be able to do two things:
</p><ol><li>Detect the Window handle of the dialog as it is created.</li><li>Intercept the <span class="code">WM_INITDIALOG</span> message as it is sent 
by the dialog.</li></ol><p>
In this sample the vbAccelerator Windows Hook library is used to detect the
dialog handle as it is created, and the <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=17">Subclassing
and Timer Assistant</a> to subclass the dialog and intercept the <span class="code">WM_INITDIALOG</span>
message.
</p><h3>1. Using the <span class="code">WH_CBT</span> hook</h3><p>
The previous section described the many notifications supplied by this hook.  In
this case detection of the dialog being created is needed; however, the hook will
also provide all sorts of other notifications, including those for every child 
control within the dialog and activation/sizing of any controls on the dialog or
your application.  Therefore you want to filter the messages you receive to
get the correct one.  Also, for best performance the hook should be installed for
as short a time as possible. 
</p><p>
This is achieved in the demonstration by:
</p><ol><li>Only installing the hook just before the dialog is about to be shown.</li><li>Checking only hook notifications with code <span class="code">HCBT_CREATEWND</span>.</li><li>Only responding to events for Windows with the class name "#32770" (which of course
is exactly the class name any reasonable person would give to a dialog if they were asked
to choose a name for one).</li></ol><p>
The code looks like this:
</p><pre>
Private Function IWindowsHook_HookProc( _
       ByVal eType As vbalWinHook.EHTHookTypeConstants, _
       ByVal nCode As Long, _
       ByVal wParam As Long, _
       ByVal lParam As Long, _
       bConsume As Boolean) As Long

   If eType = WH_CBT Then
      If nCode = HCBT_CREATEWND Then
         InstallWinProc wParam
      End If
   End If

End Function

Private Function InstallWinProc(ByVal hwnd As Long)
Dim lProcOld As Long
Dim sClass As String
Dim iPos As Long

   If IsValidLocalWindow(hwnd) Then
      If (InStr(ClassName(hwnd), "#32770")) Then
         AttachMessage Me, hwnd, WM_INITDIALOG
      End If
   End If
End Function

Private Function IsValidLocalWindow(ByVal hwnd As Long) As Boolean
   If IsWindow(hwnd) Then
      Dim idWnd As Long
      Call GetWindowThreadProcessId(hwnd, idWnd)
      IsValidLocalWindow = (idWnd = GetCurrentProcessId())
   End If
End Function

Private Property Get ClassName(ByVal hwnd As Long) As String
Dim sBuf As String
Dim iPos As Long
   sBuf = String$(255, 0)
   GetClassName hwnd, sBuf, 255
   iPos = InStr(sBuf, Chr$(0))
   If iPos &gt; 1 Then
      ClassName = Left$(sBuf, iPos - 1)
   End If
End Property
</pre><h3>Responding to the <span class="code">WM_INITDIALOG</span> message</h3><p>
Once the window has been found and the subclass installed, its just a matter
of waiting for it to finish initialising and then send the <span class="code">WM_INITDIALOG</span> 
message.  When this message is sent, the dialog has been completely set up and sized, so the
code can determine the dialog size, centre it, and then remove the subclass and hook.  The
code in the demonstration will check for multiple monitors on your system whilst centring
and attempt to place the dialog at the best position.  In more recent versions of Windows
File and Folder selection dialogs are resizable which means you can also specify the ideal
width and height you'd like for the dialog.
</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
Using a <span class="code">WH_CBT</span> hook, you can easily intercept 
the creation and destruction of any Window and obtain a handle to it even if 
that Window is not being created directly from your code (which of course is usually the
case for VB applications.)  Hooks of this type are particularly useful for
modifying the behaviour of Windows which possibly weren't intended to be modified,
particularly the Windows API dialogs.
