VB has never provided direct support for the Find/Replace common
dialogs.  This may have been because these dialogs are non-modal, and
it is more difficult to use these from an ActiveX control container,
or that it is fairly simple to knock up your own Find/Replace form
in VB without bothering with the ones provided by Windows.  
In any case, this sample provides a simple class and a module
which enable you to use the dialogs direct from VB, although
there is problem with Tab key handling in the dialogs.
</p><h2>Using The Code</h2><p>
To use the Find/Replace dialog code, first add a reference to the
<a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=17">Subclassing and Timer Assistant</a> and
then add <span class="i">cFindReplace.cls</span> and <span class="i">mFindReplaceHook.bas</span>
from the download to your project.  Now you will be able to declare 
a <span class="code">WithEvents</span> instance of the 
<span class="i">cFindReplace</span> component to your code.
</p><pre>
Private WithEvents m_cFR As cFindReplace

Private Sub Form_Load()
   
   ' Create instance of Find/Replace object
   Set m_cFR = New cFindReplace

End Sub    

Private Sub m_cFR_FindNext( _
      ByVal sToFind As String, _
      ByVal eFlags As EFindReplaceFlags _
   )
   ' Fired when find button clicked
End Sub

Private Sub m_cFR_Replace( _
      ByVal sToReplace As String, _
      ByVal sReplaceWith As String, _
      ByVal eFlags As EFindReplaceFlags _
   )
   ' Fired when replace button clicked
End Sub

Private Sub m_cFR_ReplaceAll( _
      ByVal sToReplace As String, _
      ByVal sReplaceWith As String, _
      ByVal eFlags As EFindReplaceFlags _
   )
   ' Fired when replace all button clicked
End Sub

Private Sub m_cFR_ShowHelp()
   ' Fired if the help button clicked
End Sub
</pre><p>
Now all you need to do is to show the dialog when needed and
also to respond to the events.  To show a Find dialog, call the
<span class="code">VBFindText</span> method, passing in the window
handle of the form you want to own the dialog and optionally the 
initial text to display in the find box and options controlling
the search.  Likewise, to show the Replace dialog,
call <span class="code">VBReplaceText</span>, in which case you
can also specify the initial text in the replace with text box
as well as the text to find.  You cannot display
both the Find and Replace dialogs at the same time.
</p><p>
In responding to the events, you receive the text to find/replace
and also flags specifying how to search.  These flags are bit-fields
and so you can determine if a particular option is selected
using the <span class="code">And</span> operator:
</p><pre>
    bSearchDown = ((eOptions And FR_DOWN) = FR_DOWN)
    bWholeWord = ((eOptions And FR_WHOLEWORD) = FR_WHOLEWORD)
    bMatchCase = ((eOptions And FR_MATCHCASE) = FR_MATCHCASE)
</pre><p>
Finally, you can close an open dialog using the, erm, <span class="code">CloseDialog</span>
method.  Dialogs are automatically closed if their owning form is unloaded.
</p><h2>About the Find/Replace Common Dialogs</h2><p>
The Find/Replace common dialogs are designed to be easily 
used with minimal effort from a C/C++ application.  There is just
one structure to initialise and then two API calls to make, one
for Find and one for Replace.  Whenever the user clicks one of the
buttons, a notification is sent to the owning application in the
form of a custom Window Message.
</p><p>
There are relatively few difficulties in converting the API over
to VB (I further simplified life by using the 
<a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=17">Subclassing and Timer assistant</a>
to catch the messages.  Here are the declares which provide
access to the API:
</p><pre>
Private Type FINDREPLACE
   lStructSize As Long        '// size of this struct 0x20
   hWndOwner As Long          '// handle to owner's window
   hInstance As Long          '// instance handle of.EXE that
                              '// contains cust. dlg. template
   flags As Long              '// one or more of the FR_?? flags
   lpstrFindWhat As Long      '// ptr. to search string
   lpstrReplaceWith As Long   '// ptr. to replace string
   wFindWhatLen As Integer    '// size of find buffer
   wReplaceWithLen As Integer '// size of replace buffer
   lCustData As Long          '// data passed to hook fn.
   lpfnHook As Long           '// ptr. to hook fn. or NULL
   lpTemplateName As Long     '// custom template name
End Type
Private Declare Function FindTextA Lib "COMDLG32.DLL" ( _
   tF As FINDREPLACE) As Long
Private Declare Function ReplaceTextA Lib "COMDLG32.DLL" ( _
   tF As FINDREPLACE) As Long
Private Declare Function FindTextW Lib "COMDLG32.DLL" ( _
   tF As FINDREPLACE) As Long
Private Declare Function ReplaceTextW Lib "COMDLG32.DLL" ( _
   tF As FINDREPLACE) As Long
</pre><p>
The <span class="code">FINDREPLACE</span> structure uses a pointer 
to an area in memory to hold the find and replace strings. Although
in theory you can use a pointer to a VB string to do this, I found
it easier to manage an API buffer in memory and use a couple of
helper functions called <span class="code">GetString</span> and
<span class="code">SetString</span>, which in turn use the ubiquitous 
<span class="code">CopyMemory</span> function and byte arrays to 
transfer the data to and from strings:
</p><pre>
Private Declare Function LocalAlloc Lib "kernel32" ( _
   ByVal wFlags As Long, ByVal wBytes As Long) As Long
Private Declare Function LocalFree Lib "kernel32" ( _
   ByVal hMem As Long) As Long
Private Declare Function LocalLock Lib "kernel32" ( _
   ByVal hMem As Long) As Long
Private Declare Function LocalUnlock Lib "kernel32" ( _
   ByVal hMem As Long) As Long
Private Const GMEM_FIXED = &amp;H0
Private Const GMEM_ZEROINIT = &amp;H40
Private Const GPTR = (GMEM_FIXED Or GMEM_ZEROINIT)

Private Function GetString(ByVal lPtr As Long) As String
   Dim sRet As String
   If Not (lPtr = 0) Then
      Dim b() As Byte
      ReDim b(0 To m_lBuffLen - 1) As Byte
      CopyMemory b(0), ByVal lPtr, m_lBuffLen
      If IsNt Then
         sRet = b
      Else
         sRet = StrConv(b, vbUnicode)
      End If
      Dim iPos As Long
      iPos = InStr(sRet, vbNullChar)
      If (iPos &gt; 1) Then
         GetString = Left(sRet, iPos - 1)
      End If
   End If
End Function

Private Sub SetString(ByVal lPtr As Long, ByVal sString As String)
   If Not (lPtr = 0) Then
      If (Len(sString) &gt; 0) Then
         Dim b() As Byte
         If IsNt Then
            If (Len(sString) &gt; m_lBuffLen \ 2) Then
               sString = Left(sString, m_lBuffLen \ 2)
            End If
            b = sString
         Else
            If (Len(sString) &gt; m_lBuffLen) Then
               sString = Left(sString, m_lBuffLen)
            End If
            b = StrConv(sString, vbFromUnicode)
         End If
         ReDim Preserve b(0 To m_lBuffLen) As Byte
         CopyMemory ByVal lPtr, b(0), m_lBuffLen
      End If
   End If
End Sub

' To allocate memory:
hMem = LocalAlloc(GPTR, size)
lPtr = LocalLock(hMem)

' To set the string:
SetString lPtr, "vbAccelerator.com"

' To get the string
Debug.Print GetString(lPtr)

' Clear up resources:
LocalUnlock lPtr
LocalFree hMem
</pre><p>
With this together its fairly simple to set up the <span class="code">FINDREPLACE</span>
structure and call the API functions.
</p><h2>A Problem</h2><p>
Whilst this is all workable enough, in practice there is a 
bigger problem. The Find and Replace dialogs are
non-modal.  ActiveX control containers have specific requirements
on the implementation of non-modal dialogs around the handling
of focus and the routing of key presses.  Since VB forms
are essentially implementations of ActiveX control containers 
this issue comes up when trying to use the Find and Replace dialogs.
</p><p>
If you run the sample code with any calls to the 
<span class="code">Attach</span> method of the 
<span class="i">mFindReplaceHook</span> module commented out, you'll
see the effect of this.  When the Find or Replace dialog is in 
focus hitting Return or Escape has no effect, and the Tab key causes
the system to Beep.
</p><p>
Resolving this is tricky since you don't have any access to the 
ActiveX Container interfaces you might need to fix this from VB.
The reason that the keys don't work correctly is that they are 
swallowed by the VB application rather than being directed to 
the dialog's message loop.  What you want is to force VB to stop 
eating the keys and send the message; one way of doing this is
to intercept all key presses using a Windows Hook, and to perform
custom processing and then consume them.
</p><p>
This fixes the Return and Escape keys, however for some 
reason tabs are not being processed correctly.  Whenever you
hit tab, focus is always transferred to the first text box in
the dialog. If anyone knows how to fix this it
would be greatly appreciated.
</p><h3>Using a Keyboard Hook To Process Dialog Messages</h3><p></p><h3>Keyboard Hooks and the IDE</h3><p>
One unpleasant side effect of this techinque is that since
VB debugs in the same process as the IDE, if the hook is installed
then keys normally intended for the IDE (such as Ctrl-Break and
other debugging keys) can end up being caught by the hook.  This
means that debugging becomes very difficult.  
</p><p>
You can resolve this issue by either of the following techniques:
</p><ol><li>Compile <span class="i">cFindReplace</span> and <span class="i">mFindReplaceHook</span>
into an ActiveX DLL and use that instead.</li><li>Prevent the code from attaching a hook at debug time by putting
an IDE-only line of code into the <span class="code">Attach</span> method.
</li></ol><p>
The second method is the easiest.  The code might look something like
this:
</p><pre>
Private m_bInIDE As Boolean

Private Property Get InIDE() As Boolean
   Debug.Assert IsInIDE()
   InIDE = m_bInIDE
End Property
Private Function IsInIDE() As Boolean
   m_bInIDE = True
   IsInIDE = m_bInIDE
End Function

...

Public Sub Attach(ByVal hWnd As Long)
   If (InIDE) Then
      Exit Sub
   End If

   ... 

End Sub
</pre><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
This article provides some short VB code which allows you to 
invoke the Common Dialog Find and Replace dialogs easily.  However, 
there are problems integrating non-modal API dialogs with VB 
applications.  This sample fixes most but there is still a tab
key handling problem.
