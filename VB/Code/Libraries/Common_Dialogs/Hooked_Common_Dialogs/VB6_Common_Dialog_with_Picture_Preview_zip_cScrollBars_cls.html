' Description:
' A class which can add scroll bars to VB Forms, Picture Boxes and
' UserControls.
' Features:
'  * True API scroll bars, which don't flash or draw badly like
'    the VB ones
'  * Scroll bar values are long integers, i.e. &gt;2 billion values
'  * Set Flat or Encarta scroll bar modes if your COMCTL32.DLL version
'    supports it (&gt;4.72)
'
' FREE SOURCE CODE! - ENJOY.
