All varieties of Windows NT since 3.51 include the ability to create and run multiple desktops.
Normally, this feature isn't used, and all applications run within the "Default"
desktop.  However, if you want to create a kiosk-style application which has a full-screen
interface, and prevents Ctrl+Alt+Del or any of the other standard Windows options from
being accessed, then this technique is the way to do it.
</p><h2>About Desktops</h2><p>
Windows NT is divided at the top level into <span class="i">Window Stations</span> and 
<span class="i">Desktops</span>.  More than one of each of these objects can be present at the
same time, but only one Desktop within one Window Station can be interactive at any time.
The definitions of Window Stations and Desktops can be looked up in more detail at MSDN; here's 
a quick overview:
</p><ul><li>A <span class="i">Window Station</span> contains a clipboard, global atoms and any desktops.
The Window Station assigned to the logon session of the interactive user also contains the
keyboard, mouse and display device.  Only this Window Station can be displayed to the user,
or receive user input.</li><li>A <span class="i">Desktop</span> has a logical display surface and contains windows, menus
and hooks.  Only one desktop at a time is active.  The active desktop is called the
<span class="i">Input Desktop</span> and is the one that is displayed to the active user and
that receives user input.</li></ul><p>
Under Windows XP, you will find that a logged on Windows Station typically contains three 
desktops:
</p><ol><li><span class="i">Default</span> - where Explorer (normally) runs and where you spend 
most of your time.</li><li><span class="i">Winlogin</span> - where the login screen is shown.</li><li><span class="i">Disconnect</span> - used by Terminal Services.</li></ol><h2>Creating New Desktops and Running Applications</h2><p>
Creating a new desktop for your application gives you a lot of control, but of
course that also means more responsibility.  By default, your new desktop
has nothing on it: no start menu and no task bar.  Ctrl + Alt + Del 
brings up the task manager, but it doesn't bring it up on your new desktop, it
brings it up on the Default desktop.  If you create an application which
cannot be ended in the new desktop (which is easy to do in a full-screen
application and is frequently what you want to achieve), then there is literally
no way out other than shutting down the computer with the power-down button!
</p><p>
In theory, it is possible to write an application which starts in one desktop,
creates a new desktop and then switches to it and shows its forms there.  However,
to do this you need a multi-threaded message loop, which isn't supported by VB.
Even if you could create a multi-threaded message loop, trying to use an IDE
to debug the thing would become extremely painful, since IDE errors and breakpoints
will be triggered on the IDE desktop rather than the one you're running in.
</p><p>
A somewhat easier approach is to use a <span class="i">bootstrap</span> application.  
The bootstrap application is responsible for creating the new desktop
and launching your application into it, then waiting for your application to end, at which
point it returns you to the original desktop.  The greatest advantage of this method
is you can develop your application as if it were a normal application in VB, and only
when you genuinely want it to run in kiosk mode do you need to start it from the
bootstrapper.  The disadvantage is that you have two executables, and if the user
has suitable access to the machine could in theory run the version on your local
desktop.  You can prevent this from occurring by adding a check to your release build of the
main application to confirm it is running in the correct desktop.
</p><h2>A Bootstrap Application</h2><p>
The sample provided with the downloads includes a bootstrap application which starts a new
desktop and runs the sample Kiosk application on it. It does this using 
the <span class="code">cDesktop</span> class,
which has just two methods:
</p><ul><li><span class="code">Create(ByVal sDesktopName As String)</span><br />
Creates a new desktop with the specified name.</li><li><span class="code">StartProcess(ByVal sPath As String)</span><br />
Executes the application with the specified path in the new desktop, and waits until it finishes.</li></ul><p>
Typically, then, a bootstrap application will contain something like the following in the <span class="code">Main</span> method:
</p><pre>
Public Sub Main()

   Dim cNewDesktop As New cDesktop
   
   cNewDesktop.Create "MyDesktop"
   cNewDesktop.StartProcess App.Path &amp; "\" &amp; APP_EXE_NAME
      
End Sub
</pre><p>
If you want your application to have an icon, then you can do this by creating a .res file,
as described in the article <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=2521">Icons without forms</a>.
</p><h2>cDesktop Code</h2><p>
The <span class="code">cDesktop</span> class is straightforward code.  The three
main things it has to do are:
</p><ol><li>Create a new desktop and switch to it</li><li>Start a process in the new desktop, and wait until it completes</li><li>Close the desktop</li></ol><p>
Creating a new desktop and switching are performed using the sensibly named
<span class="code">CreateDesktop</span> and <span class="code">SwitchDesktop</span>
functions. Here is the code (error handling omitted for clarity):
</p><pre>
Private Declare Function CreateDesktop Lib "user32" Alias "CreateDesktopW" ( _
      ByVal lpszDesktop As Long, _
      ByVal lpszDevice As Long, _
      pDevmode As Any, _
      ByVal dwFlags As Long, _
      ByVal dwDesiredAccess As Long, _
      lpsa As Any _
   ) As Long
Private Declare Function SwitchDesktop Lib "user32" (ByVal hDesktop As Long) As Long
Private Declare Function GetThreadDesktop Lib "user32" (ByVal dwThread As Long) As Long
Private Declare Function GetCurrentThreadId Lib "kernel32" () As Long
Private Declare Function OpenInputDesktop Lib "user32" ( _
      ByVal dwFlags As Long, _
      ByVal fInherit As Boolean, _
      ByVal dwDesiredAccess As Long _
   ) As Long
Private Const DESKTOP_SWITCHDESKTOP = &amp;H100&amp;
Private Const GENERIC_ALL = &amp;H10000000

Public Sub Create(ByVal sDesktopName As String)
   m_hDesktopThreadOld = GetThreadDesktop(GetCurrentThreadId())
   m_hDesktopInputOld = OpenInputDesktop(0, False, DESKTOP_SWITCHDESKTOP)
   m_hDesktop = CreateDesktop( _
      StrPtr(sDesktopName), ByVal 0&amp;, ByVal 0&amp;, 0, GENERIC_ALL, ByVal 0&amp;)
   SetThreadDesktop m_hDesktop
   SwitchDesktop m_hDesktop
</pre><p>
To create a process and run it on the new desktop, you must use the lower-level
<span class="code">CreateProcess</span> API rather than <span class="code">Shell</span>
or <span class="code">ShellExecute</span>, as this is the only one which
allows you to specify a desktop to run the application on.  <span class="code">CreateProcess</span>
takes a lot of parameters, but typically you don't need to fill many of
them in.  Here's the code:
</p><pre>
Private Type PROCESS_INFORMATION
   hProcess As Long
   hThread As Long
   dwProcessId As Long
   dwThreadId As Long
End Type

Private Type STARTUPINFOW
   cbSize As Long
   lpReserved As Long
   lpDesktop As Long
   lpTitle As Long
   dwX As Long
   dwY As Long
   dwXSize As Long
   dwYSize As Long
   dwXCountChars As Long
   dwYCountChars As Long
   dwFillAttribute As Long
   dwFlags As Long
   wShowWindow As Integer
   cbReserved2 As Integer
   lpReserved2 As Long
   hStdInput As Long
   hStdOutput As Long
   hStdError As Long
End Type

Private Declare Function CreateProcess Lib "kernel32" Alias "CreateProcessW" ( _
      ByVal lpApplicationName As Long, _
      ByVal lpCommandLine As Long, _
      lpProcessAttributes As Any, _
      lpThreadAttributes As Any, _
      ByVal bInheritHandles As Long, _
      ByVal dwCreationFlags As Long, _
      lpEnvironment As Any, _
      ByVal lpCurrentDirectory As Long, _
      lpStartupInfo As STARTUPINFOW, _
      lpProcessInformation As PROCESS_INFORMATION _
   ) As Long


Public Sub StartProcess(ByVal sPath As String)
Dim tSi As STARTUPINFOW
Dim tPi As PROCESS_INFORMATION
Dim lR As Long
Dim lErr As Long

   ' Must set the desktop to run on in the
   ' STARTUPINFO structure:
   tSi.cbSize = Len(tSi)
   tSi.lpTitle = StrPtr(m_sDesktop)
   tSi.lpDesktop = StrPtr(m_sDesktop)
   
   lR = CreateProcess( _
      StrPtr(sPath), ByVal 0&amp;, ByVal 0&amp;, ByVal 0&amp;, _
      1, 0, ByVal 0&amp;, ByVal 0&amp;, tSi, tPi)
   
   If (lR = 0) Then
   
      lErr = Err.LastDllError
      ' Make sure we get back into the desktop
      ' that contains the application that is
      ' using this class:
      ClearUp
      ' Now show the error
      ApiErrorHandler lErr, True
      
   Else
      
      ' Wait until the process has completed:
      WaitForSingleObject tPi.hProcess, INFINITE
      
      ' Done. Not sure if we need to close these
      ' handles, but it doesn't cause a problem
      CloseHandle tPi.hProcess
      CloseHandle tPi.hThread
           
      ' Once no more processes are running on
      ' the desktop it will automatically
      ' close.
           
   End If

End Sub
</pre><p>
To get back to the original desktop we simply
switch back to the original desktop and close the new desktop handle.  
Note that Windows automatically closes desktops which no longer have any applications 
running on them, so this is not usually necessary:
</p><pre>
Public Sub ClearUp()
   SwitchDesktop m_hDesktopInputOld
   SetThreadDesktop m_hDesktopThreadOld
   CloseDesktop m_hDesktop
End Sub
</pre><p>
The sample kiosk application demonstrates checking the desktop name to ensure
it is running in the correct desktop.  This is done using the
<span class="code">GetUserObjectInformation</span> API call:
</p><pre>
Private Declare Function OpenInputDesktop Lib "user32" ( _
      ByVal dwFlags As Long, _
      ByVal fInherit As Boolean, _
      ByVal dwDesiredAccess As Long _
   ) As Long
Private Declare Function CloseHandle Lib "kernel32" ( _
      ByVal hObject As Long _
   ) As Long
Private Declare Function GetUserObjectInformation Lib "user32" _
   Alias "GetUserObjectInformationW" ( _
      ByVal hObj As Long, _
      ByVal nIndex As Long, _
      pvInfo As Any, _
      ByVal nLength As Long, _
      lpnLengthNeeded As Long _
   ) As Long
Private Const UOI_FLAGS = 1
Private Const UOI_NAME = 2
Private Const UOI_TYPE = 3
Private Const UOI_USER_SID = 4

Private Const DESKTOP_READOBJECTS = &amp;H1&amp;

Public Function GetDesktopName() As String
Dim hDesktop As Long
Dim lR As Long
Dim lSize As Long
Dim sBuff As String
Dim iPos As Long
   
   hDesktop = OpenInputDesktop(0, False, DESKTOP_READOBJECTS)
   If Not (hDesktop = 0) Then
      lSize = (Len(DESKTOP_NAME) + 1) * 2
      ReDim bBuff(0 To lSize - 1) As Byte
      lR = GetUserObjectInformation(hDesktop, UOI_NAME, bBuff(0), lSize, lSize)
      sBuff = bBuff
      iPos = InStr(sBuff, vbNullChar)
      If (iPos &gt; 1) Then
         sBuff = Left(sBuff, iPos - 1)
      End If
      GetDesktopName = sBuff
      CloseHandle hDesktop
   End If
End Function
</pre><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>
This article demonstrates a simple way to get the an entire desktop, free of any Shell or
Explorer bits like the TaskBar or the Alt-Tab list, and also prevents the user from 
escaping from your application using Ctrl+Alt+Del.  The code will run on any NT or above 
system.
