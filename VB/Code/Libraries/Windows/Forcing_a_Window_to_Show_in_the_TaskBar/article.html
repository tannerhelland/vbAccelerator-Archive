VB provides a <span class="code">ShowInTaskBar</span> property for forms which is meant to set whether a form is shown 
in the Alt-Tab sequence and the shell's task bar. However there are two limitations to this:
</p><ol><li>The property can't be set at run-time.</li><li>Erm, it doesn't work anyway.</li></ol><p>
Ok, it can work, but only when your form has certain styles. If your form is modal, there 
is nothing you can do to put it into the task bar.  This article provides some code to force
any type of window into the taskbar.
</p><h2>ShowInTaskBar from a Windows Perspective</h2><p>
The problem with affecting built-in behaviours in Windows is that they are not 
well documented and sometimes troubling to use. The logic to put a window into the 
task bar can be dug out from MSDN although you have to search the Knowledge Base to find the answer:
</p><p>
"When you create a window, the taskbar examines the window's extended style to see if
either the <span class="code">WS_EX_APPWINDOW</span> (&amp;H40000) or <span class="code">WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW</span> 
(&amp;H80) style is turned on.
If <span class="code">WS_EX_APPWINDOW</span> is turned on, the taskbar shows a button for the window, and
if <span class="code">WS_EX_ TOOLWINDOW</span> is turned on, the taskbar does not show a button for the window.
A window should never have both of these extended styles. If the window doesn't have
either of these styles, the taskbar decides to create a button if the window is unowned
and does not create a button if the window is owned."
</p><p>
Incidentally, you use the <span class="code">GetWindow</span> API function with the <span class="code">GW_OWNER</span> flag
to determine whether a window is owned.
</p><p>
However, this doesn't acknowledge the fact that the only time the taskbar seems 
to check the styles is when the window is first created. If you create a dialog 
without these styles, then no matter what you do to change the styles afterwards, nothing happens. 
</p><h2>You can Take Control</h2><p>
VB's interface into the window creation procedure is somewhat lacking. You get 
a <span class="code">Form_Initialise</span> event when your form object is about
to be created, followed by a <span class="code">Form_Load</span> event when the form is about to be shown 
on screen. <span class="code">Form_Initialise</span> is of no use here because it is in effect an event 
fired when the object is constructed, so although the object has just come into life, 
and hence you can use local variables, the associated UI elements have not yet been created. 
Therefore you may not refer to any windows or controls at this stage. 
<span class="code">Form_Load</span> is no use either because this fires after the window has been created 
and is about to be shown. It would have been nice to get some more intermediate events, but 
I suppose this is the price to pay for having an easy to use interface. 
</p><p>
So, given that there is no VB hook into the point when the window is created, how else 
might you detect window creation?
</p><h2>The Windows Hook to the rescue</h2><p>
When all other things have failed, a Windows Hook is often a good thing to consider. 
Windows Hooks allow you to get into the message stream for your app before 
the messages get sent to it - and allows you to change or otherwise subvert the standard processing. 
</p><p>
By installing a hook of type <span class="code">WH_CALLWNDPROC</span> during an <span class="code">_Initialise</span> event, your app 
can be notified of any attempts by Windows to call a Window Procedure. This allows us to capture 
the crucial <span class="code">WM_CREATE</span> message which is sent when the window is first created. 
</p><h2>In Code - The Theory</h2><p>
The first thing to do is to install a windows hook before any windows get created 
and start watching for <span class="code">WM_CREATE</span> calls. The <span class="code">_Initialise</span> event of Forms, 
UserControls and so on always fires before any windows have been created, whilst 
all other events fire after the windows have been created, so this is a good place 
as any to install the hook for window creation checking (note that the 
<span class="code">_Initialise</span> event only fires once for a form object, so if you want this to work 
correctly you will always need a new instance of a form). Here is how to initiate the hook: 
</p><pre>
Public Sub HookAttach()
   m_hHook = SetWindowsHookEx( _
      WH_CALLWNDPROC, 
      AddressOf AppHook,
      App.hInstance, 
      App.ThreadID)
   Debug.Assert m_hHook &lt;&gt; 0
End Sub
</pre><p>
Now whenever any window in your application has its Window Procedure called, 
the hook will fire your <span class="code">AppHook</span> procedure. You can then check whether the call 
is a <span class="code">WM_CREATE</span> message and also you can isolate the particular window being created: 
</p><pre>
Private Function AppHook( _
      ByVal idHook As Long, _
      ByVal wParam As Long, _
      ByVal lParam As Long _
   ) As Long
   Dim CWP As CWPSTRUCT
   Dim k As Long, aClass As String

   If idHook &gt;= 0 Then
      CopyMemory CWP, ByVal lParam, Len(CWP)
      Select Case CWP.message
      Case WM_CREATE
         aClass = Space$(128)
         k = GetClassName(CWP.hwnd, ByVal aClass, 128)
         aClass = Left$(aClass, k)
         If IsIn(aClass, C_MDIFORMCLASS_IDE, C_MDIFORMCLASS_EXE, C_MDIFORMCLASS5_IDE, _
               C_MDIFORMCLASS5_EXE, C_FORMCLASS_IDE_DC, C_FORMCLASS_EXE_DC, C_FORMCLASS_IDE, _
               C_FORMCLASS_EXE, C_FORMCLASS5_IDE, C_FORMCLASS5_EXE) Then
            m_lHookWndProc = SetWindowLong(CWP.hwnd, GWL_WNDPROC, AddressOf Form_WndProc)
         End If
      End Select
   End If
   AppHook = CallNextHookEx(m_hHook, idHook, wParam, ByVal lParam)
End Function
</pre><p>
The constants listed above specify all the various class names that VB gives to a 
form for VB5 and VB6 - and there's a lot of them! (Thanks to Geoff Glaze for his assistance with this): 
</p><pre>
Private Const C_MDIFORMCLASS_IDE = "ThunderMDIForm"
Private Const C_MDIFORMCLASS_EXE = "ThunderRT6MDIForm"
Private Const C_MDIFORMCLASS5_IDE = "ThunderMDIForm"
Private Const C_MDIFORMCLASS5_EXE = "ThunderRT5MDIForm"

Private Const C_FORMCLASS_IDE_DC = "ThunderFormDC"
Private Const C_FORMCLASS_EXE_DC = "ThunderRT6FormDC"
Private Const C_FORMCLASS_IDE = "ThunderForm"
Private Const C_FORMCLASS_EXE = "ThunderRT6Form"
Private Const C_FORMCLASS5_IDE = "ThunderForm"
Private Const C_FORMCLASS5_EXE = "ThunderRT5Form"
</pre><p>
You will see that in the above function, I set a new Window Procedure to subclass the 
window in response to the <span class="code">WM_CREATE</span> message. Why? 
</p><p>
Well, there is a problem with calling code in response to <span class="code">WH_CALLWNDPROC</span> events. 
If you do anything during a <span class="code">WH_CALLWNDPROC</span> hook notification which would call the 
window procedure of that window again, then VB crashes. This rules out a lot - for example, you 
can't change the style of the window, and so forth. To get around this problem, you 
can use the hook notification to install a temporary subclass on the window to capture 
exactly the same message again - and then you can make as many modifications as you wish. 
</p><p>
So finally I respond to the <span class="code">WM_CREATE</span> message in a subclass procedure. As you will see, 
I just change the Extended Style of the form using <span class="code">SetWindowLong</span> and by modifying the 
Window's creation data, plus I know I no longer need the subclass so I can reinstall the 
original window procedure: 
</p><pre>
Private Function Form_WndProc( _
      ByVal hwnd As Long, _
      ByVal Msg As Long, _
      ByVal wParam As Long, _
      ByVal lParam As Long _
   ) As Long
   Dim lSetStyleEX As Long

   ' SPM - specific wnd proc for a form. 
   ' Only called once for the WM_CREATE message.

   Select Case Msg
   Case WM_CREATE
      Dim tCS As CREATESTRUCT
      CopyMemory tCS, ByVal lParam, Len(tCS)
      lSetStyleEX = GetWindowLong(hwnd, GWL_EXSTYLE)
      lSetStyleEX = lSetStyleEX Or WS_EX_APPWINDOW
      lSetStyleEX = lSetStyleEX And (Not WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW)
      tCS.ExStyle = lSetStyleEX
      CopyMemory ByVal lParam, tCS, Len(tCS)
      SetWindowLong hwnd, GWL_WNDPROC, m_lHookWndProc
      SetWindowLong hwnd, GWL_EXSTYLE, tCS.ExStyle
   End Select

   Form_WndProc = CallWindowProc( _
      m_lHookWndProc, hwnd, Msg, wParam, lParam)

End Function
</pre><h2>In Code - In Practice</h2><p>
In the download sample the code is all wrapped up into a single module, modStyles. 
All you have to do to make this work is call <span class="code">HookAttach</span> from the 
<span class="code">Form_Initialise</span> event and then call 
<span class="code">HookDetach</span> sometime later (I use the <span class="code">Form_Load</span> event because I know this 
fires after the window has been created).</p><p>
Note that it isn't crucial to do things like this.  You can attach the hook whenever
you want and detach it whenever you want as well.  Try to minimise the duration
of the Hook's effect, though, as this will make life easier in terms of
IDE stability.
</p><p>
There are a whole load of other possible uses of this code. Matt Hart has 
demonstrated how you can use this technique to modify the style of a VB 
control as it is created, for example, to create an Owner Draw Combo Box 
and an Owner Draw Tab. Have fun!
