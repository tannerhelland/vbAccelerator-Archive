' ==========================================================================
' Filename: cTitlebar.cls
' Author:   Steve McMahon
' Date:     25 November 1998
'
' Mostly based on Ben Baird's code, see below.
' Changes:
'   -Change Subclass method to SSUBTMR
'   -Added WM_STYLECHANGED and WM_SETTEXT to allow titlebar to be
'   repainted when caption changes.
'   -Icon is now drawn transparent rather than with black background
'   -Added facility to change start/end and text colours (although if
'   the end colour isn't the title bar colour, it doesn't really work)
'   -Removed WM_SIZE subclass this prevented the form
'    from being resized and/or lost the Form_Resize message
'    and was also unnecessary
'   -Now determines what buttons are present when drawing gradient
'   -Check for tool window and appropriately smaller Tbar
'   -Added owner draw background support
'

'+ Gradient titlebar example, version 1.1
'+ Author: Ben Baird
'+ Comments: Uploaded to Visual Basic Thunder
'            with Excalibur CodeLib on Monday,
'            September 1, 1997.
'            Thanks goes to Eric Dimayuga for
'            letting me bounce some ideas off
'            him. He also assisted me with the
'            theory of the code.
'
'+ If you release this code or any modified version
'  of it to the private, I would appreciate some
'  credit for the original code.
'+ FIXED IN THIS VERSION:
'   - Some trouble with the GradientGetCapsFont routine,
'   mainly a problem with the LOGFONT declaration.
'   - Added some more cleanup code.
