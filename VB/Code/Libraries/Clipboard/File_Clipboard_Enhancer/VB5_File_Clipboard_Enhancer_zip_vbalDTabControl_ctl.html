' Updates 27/04/03
' 1) Remove method ate any subscript out of range errors
' 2) Inserting a tab did not work correctly
' 3) If a tab panel was removed and then added again a subscript out of range
 occurred.
' Thanks to Michael Elashoff, Julien Margail and Matt Funnell

' Updates 06/02/03
' 1) Control is now alignable
' 2) InitProperties now initialises control, as well as ReadProperties
' 3) Flicker-Free Drawing.
' 4) Better scrolling for tabs: on MouseDown rather than MouseUp
' 5) When you remove a tab, if it has a panel it is now hidden
' 6) Clicking on tabs didn't always work when the tab was scrolled and
'    near the buttons
' 7) Added pinnable function.
