and hooking code.</p><img src="thunkSample.png" width="219" height="209" alt="Window Shadow/Fade Out Transparency Sample" /><p /><p>VB's <i>AddressOf</i> is limited in that it can only provide an address to 
a function within a module, and not one in a class.  This makes doing many things with it
harder.  However, there is a way of getting a callback to a class function, 
although you need to know a little assembler to do it.  Don't 
worry if you don't though - here Paul Caton presents some fantastic 
reusable code showing how to subclass or hook any Window without modules using this technique.
</p><h2>What's In The Download</h2><p>The download contains five different samples:</p><ol><li><strong>Shadow</strong><br />
Demonstrates a control which uses the <i>cSubClass</i> assembler thunk to add a configurable
shadow and fade-in/fade-out effects to any form.  Similar to the sample 
<a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=3487">Drop Shadows</a> except everything runs without external 
modules.</li><li><strong>SubClass</strong><br />
A full demonstration of the features of subclasser through this method.  You can choose to receive
all messages before or after they are processed by Windows, or to filter the messages for better
performance.  All using a single class...</li><li><strong>Timer</strong><br />
A completely self contained Timer which works outside forms.</li><li><strong>ApiWindow</strong><br />
Demonstrates how to create Windows with a custom class and control their behaviour through
the instantiating class.  If you've bought or glanced at Stephen Teihet's 
book "Subclassing and Hooking with Visual Basic"
then you'll immediately see how much easier it is to do it this way!</li><li><strong>Hooker</strong><br />
Not actually a soft-pr0n game as I had first hoped, but 
rather a demonstration of using the technique to install a Windows Hook for pretty
much any type of hook you care to use.  Demonstrates <i>WH_SHELL</i>, <i>WH_MOUSE</i>, <i>WH_KEYBOARD</i>,
<i>WH_FOREGROUNDIDLE</i> and the various other message related-hooks.
    </li></ol><h2>Subclassing Without Modules - A Quick Overview</h2><p>This describes the steps need to set a subclass and demonstrates using the code
to respond to the <i>WM_MINMAXINFO</i> message to prevent a form being made smaller
than a certain size.
First add <i>cSubClass.cls</i> from the download and then 
reference the included <i>WinSubHook.TLB</i> (Windows/Subclass/Hook/Timer interface 1.4).
Once this is done, you start subclassing by:</p><ol><li>Implementing the <i>ISubClass</i> interface.
<pre>
Implements iSubClass

Private Sub iSubclass_After( _
    lReturn As Long, _
    ByVal hwnd As Long, _
    ByVal uMsg As WinSubHook.eMsg, _
    ByVal wParam As Long, _
    ByVal lParam As Long)
   '
   ' Respond to any messages you want to subclass
   ' after Windows has processed them here
   '
End Sub

Private Sub iSubclass_Before( _
    bHandled As Boolean, _
    lReturn As Long, 
    hwnd As Long, 
    uMsg As WinSubHook.eMsg, 
    wParam As Long, _
    lParam As Long)
   '
   ' Respond to any messages you want to subclass
   ' before Windows has processed them here
   '
End Sub
</pre></li><li>Creating an instance of the <i>cSubClass</i> object and starting the subclasser:
<pre>
Private m_cSubClass As cSubClass

Private Sub Form_Load()

   Set m_cSubClass = New cSubClass
   ' hWnd to subclass, then object which implements
   ' iSubClass:
   m_cSubClass.SubClass Me.hWnd, Me

   ' Now you can specify individual messages to 
   ' respond to before or after Windows:
   m_cSubClass.AddMsg WM_GETMINMAXINFO, MSG_AFTER

End Sub   
</pre></li><li>Writing your subclassing code.  In this case, we use <i>WM_GETMINMAXINFO</i> to
prevent the form from being made too small:
<pre>

Private Type MINMAXINFO
   ptReserved As WinSubHook.Point
   ptMaxSize As WinSubHook.Point
   ptMaxPosition As WinSubHook.Point
   ptMinTrackSize As WinSubHook.Point
   ptMaxTrackSize As WinSubHook.Point
End Type

Private Sub iSubclass_After( _
    lReturn As Long, _
    ByVal hwnd As Long, _
    ByVal uMsg As WinSubHook.eMsg, _
    ByVal wParam As Long, _
    ByVal lParam As Long)
   '
   Dim mmiT As MINMAXINFO

   ' Copy parameter to local variable for processing
   CopyMemory mmiT, ByVal lParam, LenB(mmiT)
   
   ' Minimium width and height for sizing
   mmiT.ptMinTrackSize.x = 256
   mmiT.ptMinTrackSize.y = 256
       
   ' Copy modified results back to parameter
   CopyMemory ByVal lParam, mmiT, LenB(mmiT)
   '
End Sub
</pre></li></ol><h2>The World Is Never Enough</h2><p>Although this is by far the best subclassing sample I've seen, I would 
note that at the current release you cannot subclass the same window from more than
one class without causing a crash.  As long as you're careful about how you apply
the subclass you will be fine, but if you even inadvertently start subclassing the
same window twice (the usual way this happens is when you use the subclasser in
a user control or a DLL, and the messages you need to receive are send to the container or parent
of the object, and then you put two instances of the control on the same container - 
see <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=17">Subclassing without the crashes</a> for more
details)  you will soon start to see random crashes.  On my system this manifests itself as
the exciting vanishing window syndrome!  There are two possible ways to stop this
happening: use ComCt32.DLL v6.0 subclassing (fixes all problems; the downside is
it requires new ASM code and only works on XP) or attempt to use the Windows Properties 
database again.  I will keep you posted.</p><h2>More Information</h2><p>If you're still using VB6 then I would definitely recommend 
getting hold of a copy of Matt Currland's excellent book "Advanced Visual Basic 6".  
Although it was unfortunately published just that wee bit too late as the .NET
framework was occupying everyone else's minds, it nevertheless demonstrates 
conclusively how so many of VB's issues have a solution.  If the entirety of
Matt's ideas had been included in VB6 in a controllable way then none of us would 
have had so much to complain about when VB6 was released (not that I would complain 
about the .NET framework though; it is clearly a fantastic thing and replacing COM is something
more of an undertaking than just fixing a few annoyances with VB.  Mind you, it'll be much more
persuasive if Microsoft really do release a .NET MS Office and IE).  The book describes
the thunking technique (albeit briefly) but its certainly worth your money.
