this is great stuff!</p><h2>Three Ways To Store Objects</h2><p>Storing objects against ListBox items requires a pretty flexible way to allocate 
and remove the objects. You can add items to a ListBox, but you can also insert 
items at any position. Likewise you can delete items from any position. That really 
rules out using arrays as your storage method without a lot of pain, because whilst 
arrays are always the fastest way to work in VB if you add and remove to 
the end of the list, they are difficult to manage and slow if you want to insert 
or delete from the middle. (Although it is possible to do this; using either a
Linked List type structure or using the exciting CopyMemory array hack elsewhere on the
site!)</p><ul><li><i>Oh Dear: VB's Collection Object</i><br /><p>At first glance VB's collection object would seem to provide a good solution to 
this problem. You can Add, Insert and Delete items in the collection at any point, 
and you can store an object against each item in the collection. Also you can 
give every item in the collection a unique key to identify it, and although 
this must be a string there is no problem using a Long value (which you can use to 
link the ListBox's ItemData to the item in the collection) as long as you ensure 
VB thinks it is a string when you add the item. The sample code uses a counter to 
generate unique keys, and hence is limited to only (ahem) adding and up to 
4 billion items before it wraps and could then possibly generate a duplicate key. However 
note that that limit is equivalent to 100 days of continuous running doing nothing else 
except adding and removing objects in blocks of 100 (on my machine).</p><p>And basically this technique works... except for one thing: performance, at which 
point it blows goats. 
If the ListBox has a small number of items, everything is fine. But if the ListBox has 
thousands of items then this technique is unsuitable. I would recommend this technique 
for small numbers of items just because it is simple... except that there is 
actually an even simpler method in coding terms!</p></li><li><i>Using IUnknown and ObjPtr</i><br /><p>A COM object is fundamentally the same as a C++ object: a "reference" to an 
object is just a pointer to a structure in memory called the Virtual Table or vtable. 
In COM terms, however, there is a difference between just knowing the pointer 
to the vtable and having a workable object. This difference is enforced by the 
COM contract and implemented through the <i>IUnknown</i> interface. All COM objects must 
support this interface and all must work according to the contract in order to 
work successfully.</p><p>The IUnknown object has just three methods:</p><ol><li><i>AddRef</i></li><li><i>Release</i></li><li><i>QueryInterface</i></li></ol><p>The <i>QueryInterface</i> is the method COM and Automation can use to determine 
which facilities the object supports, and provides a directory to those objects. 
The interesting methods (at least for the purposes of this article) are the <i>AddRef</i>
 and <i>Release</i> methods.</p><p>All COM objects use an <i>AddRef</i> and <i>Release</i> scheme to determine when 
they are being used. Whenever a COM object is created, or a program obtains a 
reference to the object, the <i>AddRef</i> method of the object is called. Whenever 
a reference to an object is set to nothing (including when it goes out of scope), the 
<i>Release</i> method is called. The COM object is in charge of internally counting 
the number of <i>AddRef</i> and <i>Release</i> calls, and when its internal counter of 
references reaches 0 it terminates, freeing up any memory allocated to the object.</p><p>Since all VB objects implement the COM contract, we can take advantage of the 
<i>IUnknown</i> interface to create valid COM references to objects but without using the 
VB Object type or the native object type itself. It's easy! We just do what any 
COM-conversant object must do to store an object, i.e. keep a copy of the pointer to the 
object but also call the <i>IUnknown AddRef</i> method.</p><p>This technique would be fine, but unfortunately VB does not allow you to call either 
<i>AddRef</i> or <i>Release</i>. You can create an object reference of type <i>IUnknown</i>,
but any attempt to call the methods results in an unfriendly error message:</p><p>
"Function or interface marked as restricted, or the function uses an Automation 
type not supported in VB"
</p><p>(Incidentally, if you try to include a public method called <i>Release</i> in a VB5 
UserControl, something even worse happens! Try compiling one and see if you can interpret 
<i>that</i> error message...)
The only way to work around this is to use a version of <i>IUnknown</i> that you can 
call yourself; and that means using a Type Library. For this sample I have used 
Brad Martinez's IShellFolder Extended Type Library v1.2 (ISHF_Ex.TLB) (see the Type 
Library section for download details) to get at 
<i>IUnknown</i>; you can also find implementations in a number of other 
Type Libraries, including Bruce McKinney's Win.TLB and WinU.TLB provided with 
"Hardcore Visual Basic".</p><p>Once you have a reference to the Type Library you can then safely store classes using 
just their object pointer, like this:</p><pre>
   Private Declare Sub CopyMemory Lib "kernel32" Alias "RtlMoveMemory" ( _
       lpvDest As Any, lpvSource As Any, ByVal cbCopy As Long)


   ' To Store An Object to a Long:
   Public Sub Store(objThis As Object) As Long
      Dim iU As IShellFolderEx_TLB.IUnknown

      Set iU = objThis
      iU.AddRef
      Set iU = Nothing

      Store = ObjPtr(objThis)
      ' objThis cannot terminate until we call iU.Release on it

   End Sub


   ' To Retrieve the Object From the Long Value:
   Private Property Get ObjectFromPtr(ByVal lPtr As Long) As Object
   Dim objT As Object
       ' Bruce McKinney's code for getting an Object from the
       ' object pointer:
       CopyMemory objT, lPtr, 4
       Set ObjectFromPtr = objT
       CopyMemory objT, 0&amp;, 4
   End Property


   ' To Delete The Object:
   Public Sub Delete(ByVal lPtr As Long) As Long

      Dim objThis As Object
      Set objThis = ObjectFromPtr(lPtr)

      Dim iU As IShellFolderEx_TLB.IUnknown
      Set iU = objThis
      iU.Release
      Set iU = Nothing

      Set objThis = Nothing
      ' objThis now terminates if there are no other external 
      ' references to it.

   End Sub
</pre></li><li><i>Using IMalloc</i><br /><p>The last method took advantage of COM support in VB objects to create an "object"
 which lasts as long as the pointer to it does. Another way to create an object 
that lasts is through Persistence.</p><p>In the persistence scheme, the object is coded so it is capable of storing 
all the information required to create a completely new object that looks the same as 
the one you started with. The persistent information can be stored in a format external 
to the object itself, hence allowing a new version of the object to be stored at a later 
date by creating a new object and loading the external data in. The most obvious example 
of a persistent object in VB is the <i>UserControl</i> object, which includes a 
<i>PropertyBag</i> implementation to allow details about the UserControl to be stored 
and restored to the control's parent .FRM and .FRX files.</p><p>The only question about persistance is how to store the data. You can see some 
sample techniques for persisting information in the article "malloc in VB?" 
which demonstrates saving byte arrays, UDTs and strings. Storing longs, bytes and 
integers is simple, and it is straightforward to aggregate these techniques together. 
When I say straightforward, however, I should point out that another way of putting this is 
tedious and error prone. You can do it, but it isn't easy.</p><p>A better way of persisting data is to have a class which controls reading and 
writing data to a single memory chunk and have that provide a memory pointer for saving 
purposes. The VB <i>PropertyBag</i> object is an example of such an object - this can 
save properties in many different data types to a byte array in memory (which is 
extremely simple to persist to memory or file). Unfortunately, this object is only 
exposed in VB6 and then it is only available to public classes. A better method would be a 
<i>PropertyBag</i> which was available regardless of type and VB version 
(Hey!!! If any VB designers are reading, please mail me and tell me how come something 
I can do with only a little trouble is not possible in VB?). An example of this type of 
object at the site is the "XML Property Bag" object, which can be implemented 
by any class you choose and is adept at turning complex combinations of variables 
into a neat package. (Not just that; it has the by default benefit of delivering XML, the 
ideal way of sending your data to another machine or process...)</p></li></ul><h2>Performance Comparison</h2><p>The following table shows the results from running the sample application provided with 
the download for differing numbers of items. All the tests were performed on 
a aged 266MHz Pentium II desktop with 256Mb RAM. Below 500 items the performance 
differences are insignificant - you can use any technique you want. However, as 
the number of items increases we begin to see that the VB Collection object is useless, 
and performance worsens exponentially. Both the <i>IUnknown</i> and the <i>IMalloc</i>
schemes however provide almost equal high performance which varies much more linearly 
to the number of items. The <i>IMalloc</i> method is quickest at adding and removing items, 
whilst the <i>IUnknown</i> method is quickest for accessing items:</p><table><tr><td></td><td colspan="4">Collection</td><td colspan="4">IUnknown</td><td colspan="4">IMalloc</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Add</td><td>Enum</td><td>Clear</td><td>Total</td><td>Add</td><td>Enum</td><td>Clear</td><td>Total</td><td>Add</td><td>Enum</td><td>Clear</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>54</td><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>70</td><td>41</td><td>1</td><td>10</td><td>52</td><td>25</td><td>34</td><td>9</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>500    </td><td>190   </td><td>39   </td><td>72   </td><td>301    </td><td>110   </td><td>8   </td><td>52   </td><td>170    </td><td>84   </td><td>41   </td><td>30   </td><td>155  </td></tr><tr><td>1000    </td><td>383  </td><td>91   </td><td>224   </td><td>698    </td><td>201   </td><td>15   </td><td>94   </td><td>310    </td><td>157   </td><td>83   </td><td>69   </td><td>309  </td></tr><tr><td>5 000    </td><td>2 184   </td><td>490   </td><td>4 510   </td><td>7 184    </td><td>1 008   </td><td>73   </td><td>436   </td><td>1 517    </td><td>843   </td><td>464   </td><td>298   </td><td>1 605  </td></tr><tr><td>10 000    </td><td>4 423   </td><td>1 068   </td><td>28 531   </td><td>34 022    </td><td>1 963   </td><td>168   </td><td>857   </td><td>2 988    </td><td>1 642   </td><td>935   </td><td>502   </td><td>3 079  </td></tr><tr><td>25 000    </td><td>12 352   </td><td>8 947   </td><td>241 672   </td><td>262 971    </td><td>5 601   </td><td>793   </td><td>2 400   </td><td>8 794    </td><td>4 458   </td><td>2 149   </td><td>1 559   </td><td>8 166  </td></tr></table><p>The IUnknown reference count control method has to be highly recommended.
