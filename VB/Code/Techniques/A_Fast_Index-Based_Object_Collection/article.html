However, this object is internally implemented
as a hashed linked list, and as such provides good performance for access either by an item's key or
through enumeration.  If you want to access an object by its index, however, you need to enumerate through
all the items until you reach the correct one, which is slow.  This article presents an alternative collection
which is optimised for access by index, and, for large numbers of items, runs over 100x quicker than the VB
equivalent.</p><h2>About VB Collections</h2><p>Let's say you create a VB collection called myCollection with 10,000 items in it, 
and say the item at position 7000 has a key "BCW456007". 
Why is it quick to access the item using <i>c.Item("BCW456007")</i> but
slower to get the item using <i>c.Item(7000)</i>?</p><p>The reason for this is the internal implementation of the VB Collection itself.
A VB collection consists of two structures in memory: a linked list to store
the actual values in the collection and an internal structure known as a Hashtable
which allows quick lookup of any key to the items in the list.  We'll cover the
workings of these in turn.</p><h3>Linked Lists</h3><p>The linked list method is a classic algorithm for storing data when you want to
allocate the memory in small blocks. In a linked list, each item in the list
has an additional space allocated to store the next item in the list, as shown
below:</p><img src="linkedList.png" width="485" height="110" alt="Linked List Structure" /><p>The advantage of a linked list is it is very easy to insert or remove items.
All you need to do is allocate the new item and then change the pointer of the
item prior to the one you're inserting, and set the pointer to the next item
along:</p><img src="linkedListInsert.png" width="481" height="232" alt="Inserting into a Linked List" /><p>Likewise removal is very efficient: an you simply find the next pointer associated with
the item to remove, remove the item and then change the pointer for the previous item in the
list to the pointer for the item you just removed.</p><p>Many linked-list implementations store both a forward and a backward pointer to make it
easier to find the previous item in the list as well as the next one.  Lists constructed this
way are called "Double Linked Lists" and it is likely that internally the VB
collection is implemented this way.</p><p>However, the high efficiency for adding, removing and inserting items is offset against
the increased difficulty in finding the item at a particular index in the linked list.  
If you are interested in the 10,000th item in the list, you have to start at the beginning and
follow 10,000 pointers until you get there (or, if the list is doubly-linked you
could choose to start from the beginning or the end depending on how far the item you're 
looking for is from the count of the collection).</p><h3>Hashtables</h3><p>A Hashtable is a lookup structure which aims to make finding a particular item more
efficient.  The idea is to reduce the number of data items which are accessed before you
get the pointer to the data you're interested in, and the way it works is related to the
way indexes in databases work (although it is less sophisticated).</p><p>A simple hashtable is implemented as follows: firstly, a hashing function is defined.
This is a function which converts a key of arbitrary size to a number within a fixed
range.  The idea is that the hash function will produce a nicely even distribution
of hash values for a given key.  Then, an array for each of the possible hash values.  Each
element in this array then stores a linked list of the actual keys and then a pointer to 
the data itself within the main list.</p><p>So to find a particular item by its key, you do the following:</p><ol><li>Determine the Hash of the key using the Hash function</li><li>Find the linked list from the array containing all of the hash tables. If there isn't
anything there, then the key doesn't exist, otherwise...</li><li>Enumerate the values in the linked list until you find one with a matching key 
(remember that you are reducing a key of arbitrary size to a shorter, fixed range list, 
so different keys may have the same Hash code).  When found, you have the item.</li></ol><p>This may sound like it all takes a long time to do, but for long lists in fact turns out 
many times quicker than searching through the entire list because so much less searching is
involved (assuming that the Hash function is any good!).</p><p>An example of a class which implements a string hash function in VB is as follows:</p><pre>
' Size of HashTable
Private m_lHashTableSize As Long          

' Pseudorandom cryptographic array used to mix up
' the input data and create a hash function with
' good chance of preventing clashes:
Private rand8(0 To 255) As Long

Private Sub Class_Initialize()
Dim i As Long, j As Long
Dim s As Byte, k As Long
   
   ' Create a pseudorandom array using the
   ' alleged RC4 algorithm.
   ' See:
   ' http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/pearson.html
   ' This initialisation is to prevent a low repeat count:
   For i = 0 To 255
      rand8(i) = i
   Next i
   ' Here we go:
   k = 7
   For j = 0 To 3
      For i = 0 To 255
         s = rand8(i)
         k = (k + s) Mod 256
         rand8(i) = rand8(k)
         rand8(k) = s
      Next i
   Next j
   ' Hash table is 65k in size.  This should remain
   ' very efficient for &gt; 200,000 items.
   m_lHashTableSize = &amp;HFFFF&amp;
   
End Sub

Private Function Hash(ByVal sKey As String) As Long
Dim b() As Byte
Dim i As Long
Dim lKeyVal As Long
Dim h1 As Long, h2 As Long
   
   ' using hashing algorithm "Variable String Exclusive-Or
   ' method (tablesize up to 65,536)".  See
   ' Dictionaries -&gt;Hash Tables section at
   ' http://members.xoom.com/thomasn/s_man.htm
   b = sKey
   h1 = b(0): h2 = h1 + 1
   For i = 1 To UBound(b)
      h1 = rand8(h1 Xor b(i))
      h2 = rand8(h2 Xor b(i))
   Next
   lKeyVal = h1 * &amp;HFF&amp; + h2
   Hash = lKeyVal Mod m_lHashTableSize
   
End Function
</pre><p>Thus you should be able to see that a VB collection is very efficient for
adding, inserting and removing items, and is also quick for finding items
by their Key.  But it will always be slow if you want to access the item
by index.  So what if you want to access by index?</p><h2>Arrays as Collections</h2><p>The most efficient way of storing data so it is easily accessible by 
index is in an array with fixed length members.  In an array, data is
stored as a contiguous block of memory (although this means that it is more
likely you'll run out of memory using arrays than linked lists, that doesn't
happen so frequently these days).  To find any item within
the array, you simply need to know the size of each member and the
pointer to the top of the array; then you can directly derive the 
pointer to the item.</p><p>On the other hand, insert and remove performance is generally much
worse because if you need to shift all the items below the item you're
inserting or removing.  However, you can make these operations almost
as quick as a VB Collection by taking advantage of the Win32 API block
memory copy function.  That's what I've built in this article and as
you'll see later the performance can be extremely good.</p><p>First, we'll look at implementing an index collection using VB arrays.
In the download "VB Index Collection Techniques" this is 
implemented as <i>cIndexCollection</i>. In my implementation I
store a larger array than is necessary, increasing the size by 
a chunk each time more memory is needed (the <i>AllocationSize</i>).
This reduces the number of times you need to reallocate the array
and hence hopefully improves performance.</p><ul><li>Adding an Item<br />
Adding an item is straightforward: just ensure the array is of sufficient
size and then set the element:
<pre>
   m_lCount = m_lCount + 1
   If m_lCount &gt; m_lArraySize Then
      m_lArraySize = m_lArraySize + m_lAllocationSize
      ReDim Preserve m_lItem(1 To m_lArraySize) As Long
   End If
   m_lItem(m_lCount) = Value
</pre></li><li>Inserting an Item<br />
When inserting an item, you need to shift everything after the index up
one prior to inserting:
<pre>
   m_lCount = m_lCount + 1
   If m_lCount &gt; m_lArraySize Then
      m_lArraySize = m_lArraySize + m_lAllocationSize
      ReDim Preserve m_lItem(1 To m_lArraySize) As Long
   End If

   ' Shift up from Index to m_lCount-1
   For j = m_lCount - 1 To Index Step -1
      m_lItem(j + 1) = m_lItem(j)
   Next j
   ' Set item at Index
   m_lItem(Index) = Value
</pre></li><li>Removing an Item<br />
Likewise if you're removing an item, you need to shift everything above
the item which is being removed unless the item being removed is at
the end:
<pre>
   ' shift down from Index to m_lCount-1
   For j = Index + 1 To m_lCount
      m_lItem(j - 1) = m_lItem(j)
   Next j
   m_lCount = m_lCount - 1
</pre></li></ul><p>Testing the performance of this approach demonstrates that although you
can read through the items in the array many times quicker (over 100x if
the list is large) than a collection, inserting and removing are very slow.</p><p>To improve matters, we can use the Win32 API <i>RtlMoveMemory</i> block copy
function  to shift a large number of elements at the same time.  Here's the
function to insert an item modified to use this approach.  First we note
that an item within an array of longs, if passed by reference to the API
function, provides the pointer to its location in memory.  This avoids any
pointer arithmetic to work out where an item is within the array.  Then remembering
that the array is a contiguous block of memory and a long has 4 bytes can work out
what size to copy:</p><pre>
Private Declare Sub CopyMemory Lib "kernel32" Alias "RtlMoveMemory" ( _
    lpvDest As Any, lpvSource As Any, ByVal cbCopy As Long)

...

      lTemp = m_lItem(m_lCount)
      ' Increase array size as required:
      m_lCount = m_lCount + 1
      If m_lCount &gt; m_lArraySize Then
         m_lArraySize = m_lArraySize + m_lAllocationSize
         ReDim Preserve m_lItem(1 To m_lArraySize) As Long
      End If
      ' Shift up from Index to m_lCount-1
      CopyMemory m_lItem(Index + 1), m_lItem(Index), (m_lCount - Index) * 4
      ' Increase array size:
      ' Set item at Index
      m_lItem(Index) = Value
      ' Set last item:
      m_lItem(m_lCount) = lTemp
</pre><p>Using this method, the Insert and Remove performance is now on a par with the VB
collection - just slightly slower.  Try the sample code with 10,000 items: here's 
the results from my AMD XP2200 box.  Note that when removing, the code uses the
worst case by removing the first item. All times given in ms:</p><table><tr><td>Collection</td><td>Add 10,000</td><td>Insert 10,000</td><td>Read 10,000</td><td>Remove 10,000</td></tr><tr><td>VB Collection</td><td>49</td><td>94</td><td>2866</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Index Collection (VB code)</td><td>63</td><td>893</td><td>41</td><td>931</td></tr><tr><td>Index Collection (Optimised)</td><td>73</td><td>266</td><td>41</td><td>145</td></tr></table><h2>Using the Code to Store Something Useful</h2><p>Although this demonstrates that a faster index collection is possible, the code
above only stores Long values. To make it more useful, there is also a version which
allows you to store Objects.  This is provided in the "VB Object Index Collection"
download.  This extends the implementation above to use the techniques described in the
article <a href="http://www.vbaccelerator.com/article.asp?id=2192">Storing Objects Against ItemData and Tag Properties</a>
in order to store objects against the long values in the array. Performance results for
10,000 items again are as follows (note in this case the <i>Remove</i> was set to remove
from the end of the array, which VB's Collection isn't so good at):</p><table><tr><td>Collection</td><td>Add 10,000</td><td>Insert 10,000</td><td>Read 10,000</td><td>Remove 10,000</td></tr><tr><td>VB Collection</td><td>116</td><td>163</td><td>7581</td><td>8277</td></tr><tr><td>ArrayList</td><td>146</td><td>409</td><td>52</td><td>106</td></tr></table><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>VB's Collection offers good performance for adding and inserting items, and accessing and
removing them by their Keys.  However, performance is poor if items are to be accessed by
index.  If you want a collection to access objects by index, the <i>cArrayList</i>
implementation provided here can improve performance by over 100x.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p></td><td class="rightbar" valign="top" bgcolor="#C2BEB1">
